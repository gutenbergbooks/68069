<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smaller">A GREAT PROCONSUL; AND OTHER PHENOMENA</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great Proconsul stood on one of Messrs. Maple’s
best hearthrugs in Grosvenor Square. A typical payer
of the super-tax, a pink and prosperous gentleman in
a morning coat and striped trousers, his appearance
had long commanded the admiration of his country.</p>

<p>He had not ruled the teeming millions of the Ganges,
although the strength of his digestion and his absence
of imagination would at any time have enabled him to
do so. But for a period of nine weeks he had been the
Resident of Barataria North-West; and partly for that
reason and partly for a reason even more cogent, he had
the distinction of being the last peer created by Mr.
Vandeleur’s last government.</p>

<p>The world is familiar with Sir William Richmond’s
fine portrait of Walter Augustus, first Baron Shelmerdine
of Potterhanworth now, on loan at the National
Portrait Gallery. In this the national asset appears as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>he encountered his Sovereign in knee breeches, silk
stockings, shoe buckles and other regalia.</p>

<p>Competent judges consider it an excellent likeness,
and of course quite unexceptionable as a work of art.
It is the portrait of a happily endowed Englishman in
his manly prime, to which the nation at large is able to
refer between the hours of ten and four, Fridays excepted.</p>

<p>Eton, Balliol, diplomacy, private means, together with
various places of emolument under the Crown, had each
a share in raising Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth to
his elevation. A first baron certainly, but not a mushroom
growth. The honors of a grateful nation had
come to him mainly because he had not been able to
avoid them. From early youth he had been ranged
with those who always do the right thing at the right
time in the right way. He had always hit the bull’s-eye
so exactly in the centre that public regard had had
to strive to keep pace with his progress.</p>

<p>Up till the age of one-and-thirty, Shelmerdine&mdash;not
then of Potterhanworth&mdash;had like humbler mortals
just a sporting chance of getting off the target. But
at the age of thirty-one he married. By that judicious
action he forfeited any little chance he may have had
of dying an obscure, private individual.</p>

<p>Sociologists differ as to what is the most portentous
phenomenon of the age in which we dwell, but there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>a body of the well-informed which awards the palm unhesitatingly
to that amiable institution, the Suffolk Colthurst.</p>

<p>The world is under great obligations to this interesting
representative of the higher mammalia. The upper
reaches of Theology are whitened with the bones of the
Suffolk Colthurst. It makes an almost ideal Under-Secretary,
it is always so smooth-spoken and well-brushed;
it makes a most excellent Judge; there is no
place of emolument it is not fitted to grace; and in the
unlikely event of a doubt invading your mind as to
whether the particular schoolmaster will be inducted to
the vacant see of Wincanton, you have only to look up
which branch it was of the Suffolk Colthursts into which
he married, and at what period of his life he married her.</p>

<p>What would be the Established Order without the
Colthurst of Suffolk? What would be the Navy and
Army, Law and Medicine, Parliament itself, Art&mdash;and
yes, gentlemen!&mdash;Letters, without the Colthurst of Suffolk?</p>

<p>It is an error, however, to suppose that this pleasant
phenomenon confines itself to one little corner of the
globe. The Colthurst is indigenous to Suffolk, but for
generations there has been quite a colony settled in Kent.
There is also the world-famous Scotch variety, and of
late traces of the Suffolk Colthurst have been found in
America. The Transatlantic mind, never slow at diagnosis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and with its trick of masterful and telling speech,
has already ventured to define its creed. In America
the creed of the Suffolk Colthurst has been defined as the
Art of Getting There with Both Feet.</p>

<p>Please do not assume that there is anything ignoble
about the Colthurst of Suffolk. Quite the contrary. It
has been laid down as a general principle that the Suffolk
Colthurst never makes money but always marries it.
That is not to say, of course, that a Suffolk Colthurst
has never been known to make money, because such a
statement, however pleasant, would be in excess of the
truth. But the Suffolk Colthurst, <i>pur sang</i>, sets less
store by the making of money than by the spending of
money in the way that shows it has always had money to
spend.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it always has had money to spend.
As soon as banking, brewing, land-jobbing, share-broking,
and other polite arts began to flourish in Suffolk,
the Colthurst began to marry and to give in marriage.
And to this day if you enter a small private bank in a
quiet cathedral city, and you take the trouble to make
inquiries, you are quite likely to learn that the local Suffolk
Colthurst has the chief proprietary interest in the
concern. The family has always been partial to banking.
It is such an eminently sensible practice to lend
money at double the rate at which you borrow it; and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>has the additional advantage that you can’t call it
Trade.</p>

<p>Our immediate business, however, is with the blameless
gentleman who at the age of one-and-thirty was
accepted in marriage by a charming representative of
the genus, and at the age of nine-and-fifty was made a
peer by Mr. Vandeleur’s government, immediately antecedent
to its total and permanent eclipse.</p>

<p>To return, then, to Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth.
For nearly an hour had he occupied the tasteful hearthrug
provided by Messrs. Maple. A frown chequered
his serene front and several times he had recourse to the
Leading Morning Journal which lay open on his writing-table
at page four.</p>

<p>At the top of the third column was a communication
dated from the Helicon Club, S. W. It was signed by
himself and had been crowned with the glory of the
largest type you could have without having to pay for
it. Immediately below, in type equally glorious, were
communications veiled in the discreet anonymity of “A
Lover of Animals” and “Verax.”</p>

<p>Discreet anonymity is disagreeable as a rule. The
fact was the great Proconsul was in the act of rendering
a signal service to the Public; and in consequence
the Public did not thank him for his interference. To
be sure, it was the first time in his life that he had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>guilty of such an indiscretion. This was his first single-handed
attempt to render a service to society at large;
and, as was only to be expected, society at large was not
making itself very pleasant about it.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that at this moment the great
Proconsul was the most unpopular man in London. Old
ladies in ermine tippets scowled at him as he passed
along Park Lane; and a hostess of mark, famous for
her wealth and her humanity, had already crossed him
out of her dinner list.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">TOUCHES UPON A MATTER OF GRAVE PUBLIC<br />
IMPORTANCE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> what crime, do you suppose, has S. of P. been
guilty? It was merely that in a public print he had
ventured to ask why the payment of the nominal sum
of seven and sixpence per annum conferred upon the
dogs of London certain privileges in respect of its pavements
which society at large, for some little time past,
has ceased to claim.</p>

<p>The resources of civilization were ranged already
against Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth. Nice-minded
women in point lace refused to meet the self-constituted
champion of public amenity; the black-velveted mistresses
of the Flossies and the Fidos thought the state
of his mind must be unpleasant; he was an object of
contumely where all that was fair and of good report
held sway in the life of the metropolis.</p>

<p>It was a pretty quarrel, and both sides were sustaining
it with spirit. The Pro-Darlings, with Verax and a
Lover of Animals at their head, had rejoined with mannerly
vituperation to the polished sarcasm of the Anti-Darlings.
What is your remedy? had inquired the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>Friends of Fido with a rather obvious sneer. Banish
the dumb creation from the pavements of great cities,
had replied Inspired Commonsense.</p>

<p>And for our own poor part, Commissioners of the
Office of Works, we think that reply is worth a statue.</p>

<p>Verax was making merry though at the expense of a
public ornament, and the occupant of Messrs. Maple’s
best hearthrug, who remembered Verax perfectly well
as a grubby infant at his private school, had already
formed the pious resolve of putting the fear of God into
Verax.</p>

<p>S. of P., having pondered long, sat down at his writing-table;
dipped his quill with a certain inherent natural
grandeur, and started out on his crushing reply:&mdash;“Sir,
I have read with amazement the diatribe against
my humble and unworthy self which appears under the
signature of Verax, to which you have extended the generous
hospitality of your columns.”</p>

<p>At this point S. of P. bit his quill with such violence
that a large blot was shaken from the end of it upon the
monogram which decorated the communication.</p>

<p>“The problem as I envisage it”&mdash;S. of P. took a
small gold pencil out of his waistcoat pocket and made
a note on his blotting pad. “The problem as I envisage
it”&mdash;but the problem that he did envisage was the Suffolk
Colthurst, who at that moment entered the room.</p>

<p>The Suffolk Colthurst was large and blonde&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>large and so blonde that to a profane mind she rather
conveyed the suggestion of a particularly well-grown
cauliflower.</p>

<p>“Wally, <i>please</i>, don’t let me spoil your morning.
Don’t let me interrupt you, <i>please</i>.”</p>

<p>The voice of the Suffolk Colthurst was really quite
agreeable, although a little light in the upper register.
You might even call it flutelike if you cared to indulge
in metaphor.</p>

<p>“Not at all, Agatha,” said S. of P. with excellent
chest resonance. “I am merely envisaging the problem
of the&mdash;ah&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i>, Wally.” The voice of the Suffolk Colthurst
was perhaps a shade less flutelike if history really calls
for these <i>nuances</i>. “You are making yourself ridiculous.
Please drop the subject.”</p>

<p>“No, Agatha.” The sun setting over Africa might
be compared to the brow of the great Proconsul. “Man
in <i>The Thunderer</i> most impertinent. Signs himself
Verax. Suspect it’s that fellow&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wally.” The Suffolk Colthurst roared here a little
less gently than usual. “I will not uphold you!
Everybody thinks it is most injudicious.”</p>

<p>“Everybody, Agatha?”</p>

<p>“Paul and Millicent consider&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Public health, Agatha, public dec&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wally, once for all, I absolutely refuse to discuss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>the subject. I will not have you make yourself ridiculous.”</p>

<p>The Suffolk Colthurst, with an approximation to natural
majesty, put on a pair of gold-rimmed eyeglasses
which were suspended round her neck by a cord, and
took the Leading Morning Journal off the First Baron’s
table.</p>

<p>“Impertinent, certainly. Sarcasm, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Suspect it’s that fellow Huffham, because I declined
to propose him under Rule Two.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you do appear to have laid yourself open,
but the letter is most ill-natured.”</p>

<p>“As though I should be likely to propose him.
Known the man all my life.”</p>

<p>The Suffolk Colthurst gathered her majestic inches
for the ultimatum.</p>

<p>“Wally, you must listen to me. This matter has
already gone too far. Let it drop. It is the first time
I have known you go out of your way to make yourself
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Public health, Agatha, public decency.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to the County Council.”</p>

<p>“They are not competent to envisage such a problem
as this. And I am determined, in the face of that
letter&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Paul says that no man can afford to make himself
a public laughing-stock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Paul’s a coward.”</p>

<p>“Paul says they are certain to make you an Apostle.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t make a fool of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Paul said that! Why, pray, should they make me
an Apostle?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s nobody else; and people will say
the race has already passed its zenith if the vacancy is
not filled up at once.”</p>

<p>“I will say this for Paul&mdash;he is well-informed as a
rule.”</p>

<p>“Wait, Wally, until you are an Apostle.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, with the greatest possible reluctance
I yield the point for the present. Verax shall wait until&mdash;Tell
me, Agatha, what have you to say to me?”</p>

<p>The good, the noble&mdash;forgive our fervor, O ye Liberal
organs of opinion, even if <i>your</i> bosoms be not
thrilled by this whole-souled devotion to the public weal&mdash;the
good and noble Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth
flung the offending print upon Messrs. Maple’s expensive
carpet in a sudden uncontrollable access of private
pique.</p>

<p>“Agatha.” The accents of the great Proconsul
were choked with emotion. “Tell me, Agatha, what
you have to say to me?”</p>

<p>“Wally,” said the Suffolk Colthurst, “what I have
to say to you is this.”</p>

<span class="smaller">IS DOMESTIC IN THE MAIN, BUT WE HOPE<br />
NOT UNWORTHY OF A GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
STATESMAN</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you are up against a serious anticlimax it is
a golden rule to begin a fresh chapter.</p>

<p>The Suffolk Colthurst paused, and sat with a further
access of natural majesty upon a chair Louis Quinze,
supplied, like the hearthrug, by Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>“Wally, Philip has declined to come to the Queen’s
Hall this afternoon to hear Busoni.”</p>

<p>Doing his best even in this dangerous anticlimax, S.
of P. retrieved the Leading Morning Journal from the
carpet, straightened out its crumpled folds with patient
humility, laid it on the table, sat down in his own chair&mdash;Tottenham
Court Road of the best period&mdash;put up
his eyeglass&mdash;by Cary of Pall Mall, maker to the
Admiralty&mdash;and, in the voice of one pronouncing a
benediction, said, “Well, Agatha?”</p>

<p>“Actually declined. Tells me he’s engaged to a pantomime
at Drury Lane.”</p>

<p>“Matter of taste, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“Taste, Wally! Dear Adela is coming, and I have
taken such trouble to arrange this.”</p>

<p>The Proconsul showed a little perturbation.</p>

<p>“No accounting for taste, I presume. Why a man
of his age, rising twenty-eight, should prefer&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wally, it is very wrong, and you must speak to him.
It is not kind to dear Adela. Please ring the bell.”</p>

<p>The Proconsul rang the bell, and a young and very
good-looking footman attended the summons.</p>

<p>“Joseph,” said his mistress, “if Mr. Philip has not
gone yet, tell him, please, that his father would like to
see him.”</p>

<p>After a lapse of about five minutes, a young man
sauntered into the library. He was a somewhat somber-looking
young man in a chocolate-colored suiting.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Philip,” said the First Baron.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, father,” said the heir to the barony.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said the First Baron, “your mother tells me
that you have declined to accompany her and Adela
Rocklaw to the Albert Hall this afternoon to hear
Paderewski.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony knitted the intellectual forehead
that was his by inheritance.</p>

<p>“Not declined, you know, exactly. It’s a bit of a
mix. I thought the concert was next Saturday.” Mr.
Philip was a slow and rather heavy young man, but his
air was quite sweet and humble, and not without a sort
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>of tacit deference for both parents. “Fact is, I was
keepin’ next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Why not go this afternoon as you have got wrong
in the date? Your mother has been at so much trouble,
and I am sure Adela Rocklaw will be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately I’ve fixed up this other thing.”</p>

<p>“Engaged to a music hall, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Pantomime at Drury Lane,” said Philip the sombre.</p>

<p>“Quite so.” The Proconsul, like other great men,
was slightly impatient of meticulous detail in affairs
outside his orbit. “Hardly right, is it, to disappoint
Adela Rocklaw, especially after your mother”&mdash;Mother,
still mounted on the Louis Quinze, sat with eyelids
lowered but very level&mdash;“has taken so much trouble?
At least I, at your age, should not have thought
so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Philip pondered a little.</p>

<p>“A bit awkward perhaps. I say, Mater, don’t you
think you could fix up another day?”</p>

<p>The gaze of Mother grew a little less abstract at this
invocation.</p>

<p>“Impossible, Phil-ipp”&mdash;the Rubens-Minerva countenance,
whose ample chin was folded trebly in rolls of
adipose tissue was a credit to the Governing Classes&mdash;“Dear
Adela goes to High Cliff on Wednesday for the
shooting.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry,” said Mr. Philip quite nicely and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>politely, “that I shall have to go to Drury Lane this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“<i>Have</i> to go, Phil-ipp!” Still ampler grew the
Governing Classes. “It is really impossible in the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“What circumstances, Mater?”</p>

<p>“Dear Adela.”</p>

<p>“She won’t mind, if you explain. It’s like this, you
see. Teddy Clapham has taken a box for his kids, and
I promised ’em I’d be there&mdash;and you can’t go back
on your word with kids, can you?”</p>

<p>“Why not, Phil-ipp?” inquired the Governing
Classes.</p>

<p>“Sort of gives ’em wrong views about things, you
know.”</p>

<p>“How absurd,” said Mother. “Much too sentimental
about children nowadays. Telephone to Mr.
Clapham and explain the circumstances. I am sure he
will understand that as dear Adela is going to High
Cliff on Wednesday&mdash;”</p>

<p>A cloud gathered on the brow of Philip.</p>

<p>“May be wrong, you know, Mater, but I really can’t
go back on my word with kids. I promised ’em, you
know, and that little Marge is a nailer, and she is only
five.”</p>

<p>The statement, in spite of its sincerity, did not seem
to carry conviction to either parent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>The heir to the barony was a dutiful young man; at
least, in an age which has witnessed a somewhat alarming
decline in parental authority, he passed as such.
His deference, perhaps, was not of a type aggressively
old-fashioned, but he honored his father and his mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a box for the ‘Chocolate Soldier’ on Monday
if you and Adela will come, Mater, but I don’t see
how I can throw over Teddy Clapham’s kids&mdash;five of
’em&mdash;toddlers&mdash;and they ain’t got a mother, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp, this is ridiculous. And dear Adela will be
so disappointed, and on Monday there is a reception at
the Foreign Office.”</p>

<p>“You can go on afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But your father and I are engaged to dinner with
the Saxmundhams.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mater, I’m sorry. I hope you’ll explain to
Adela. Got mixed in the date and if it hadn’t been kids
I really would in the circumstances&mdash;”</p>

<p>The door knob was now in the hand of the heir to the
barony.  Parthian bolts were launched at him, but he
made good his escape.</p>

<p>“It’s a nuisance,” he muttered as he closed the door
behind him, “but I really don’t see what’s to be done in
the circumstances.”</p>

<p>In the entrance hall he put on his hat and was helped
by Joseph into an overcoat with an astrachan collar;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>from the hall stand he took a whanghee cane with massive
silver mountings, and sauntered forth pensively to his
house of call, that was not very far from the corner of
Hamilton Place.</p>

<p>Arrived at that desirable bourn, his first act was to
ring up 00494 Wall.</p>

<p>“That you, Teddy? Have you told the kids to feed
early to be in time for the risin’ of the curtain? Yes,
I’ve bought the Bukit Rajahs.  Think so? Yes, not a
minute later than a quarter-past one.”</p>

<p>Replacing the receiver, the heir to the barony of
Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth recruited exhausted nature
with a whisky and apollinaris, and put forth from
the chaste portals of the Button Club.  Adventures were
lying in wait for him, however.</p>

<p>As he rounded the corner into Piccadilly, a little unwarily,
it must be confessed, he nearly collided with the
<i>Ne Plus Ultra</i> of fashion in the person of a tall and decidedly
smart young woman, in a rather tight black
velvet hobble and a charming mutch with a small strip
of white fur above the left eyelid.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH THE GENTLE READER HAS THE<br />
HONOR OF AN INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />
SEVENTH UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OF NOT<br />
QUITE A HUNDRED EARLS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Ne Plus Ultra</i> had just achieved the feat of
crossing from the Green Park in the charge of a quadruped
of whom we are at a loss to furnish a description
more explicit. How and why it had been allowed to
escape a death by violence at the instance of the passing
motor and other mechanically propelled vehicles was yet
another of the dark secrets which must be left in the
keeping of its Maker.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, Adela!”</p>

<p>Jamming the brakes hard on, the heir to the barony
was just able to avert a forcible impact with the fearsome
four-footed beast which measured eighteen inches
and a quarter from the tip of its tail to the end of its
muzzle.</p>

<p>“What is it, Adela? Win it in a raffle?”</p>

<p>The seventh unmarried daughter of not quite a hundred
earls was a little inclined to stiffen at this freedom
with an Honorable Mention at the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>“It is a pure-bred rough-haired Himalayan Dust
Spaniel, and they are very rare.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>This ill-timed remark did not seem to help the conversation.
The seventh unmarried daughter of not
quite a hundred earls&mdash;she was the daughter of only
three earls really, although for that she cannot accept
responsibility&mdash;tilted her chin to its most aristocratic
angle and displayed considerable reserve of manner.</p>

<p>An eyelash, lengthy and sarcastic, flickered upon her
cheek.</p>

<p>“Pure-bred rough-coated Himalayan Dust Spaniel,”
said the heir to the barony. “Stick him in your muff,
or you might lose him.”</p>

<p>“You are coming to the concert, aren’t you?” said
the seventh unmarried daughter in a tone singularly detached
and cool.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid,” said the heir to the barony. “Awfully
sorry, Adela, but fact is I’ve got mixed in the day.
Thought it was next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve promised five little kidlets I’d take ’em to
the Pantomime at Drury Lane. You don’t mind,
Adela, do you?&mdash;or I say, would you care to come?
You’ll find it a deal more amusin’ than Paderewski.
We’ve got a box, and there’ll be any amount of room.
And you won’t need a chaperone with five kids and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>nannas, and the Mater needn’t go to Kubelik then, because
she hates all decent music worse than I do. Better
come, Adela. Pantomime is awfully amusin’, and
you’ll like Clapham if you haven’t met him&mdash;chap, you
know, that married poor little Bridgit Brady.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said the young madam, “but I think I
prefer Busoni.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was rather concerned by the
tone of Miss Insolence.</p>

<p>“You aren’t rattled, are you, Adela?” said he.
“I’ve made a horrid mess of it, and I’m to blame and all
that, but you can’t go back on your word with kids,
can you? If you come I’m sure you’ll like it, and that
little Marge is a nailer, and she is only five.”</p>

<p>The long-lashed orb from beneath the charming
mutch showed very cold and blue.</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I think I prefer Busoni. Come,
Fritz.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry,” said the penitent heir; and the
rather tight hobble and the charming mutch and the
pure-bred Himalayan dust spaniel moved round the
corner of Hamilton Place in review order.</p>

<p>Humbled and undone, the heir to the barony sauntered
up the street, past the Cavalry, past the Savile and
past the Bath, until, broken in spirit he stayed his course
before the chocolate shop of B. Venoist.</p>

<p>“She’s as cross as two sticks,” sighed the heir to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>barony, as he gazed in at the window. “Always was a
muddlin’ fool&mdash;but you can’t go back on your word
with kids, can you? Now I must be careful which sort
I choose. I expect that sort in pink boxes will make
’em as sick as Monday mornin’.”</p>

<p>In this opinion, however, B. Venoist did not concur.
He assured the heir to the barony that it was exactly
the same quality as that supplied to Buckingham Palace,
The Durdans, High Cliff Castle and Eaton Hall.</p>

<p>“If that is so,” said the heir to the barony, “I think
I’ll risk a box.” “Looks pretty poisonous,” he added&mdash;although
not to B. Venoist.</p>

<p>“You’ll find that all right, sir,” said B. Venoist.
“Precisely the same quality as supplied to York Cottage.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad o’ that,” said the heir to the barony, disbursing
a sum in gold and dangling a large but neat
white paper parcel from his index finger.</p>

<p>“Cross as two sticks,” mused the stricken young man,
putting forth from the chocolate shop of B. Venoist,
and bestowing a nod in passing upon a choice light blue
striped necktie.</p>

<p>By some odd association of ideas this article of attire
was responsible for his course being stayed before his
favorite shop window a little farther along the street:
to wit, of Mr. Thomas Ling, whose neckties in the
opinion of some are as nice as any in London.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>“Have you an Old Etonian Association necktie?” he
asked of Mr. Thomas Ling, although he knew quite
well that Mr. Thomas Ling had, and a Ramblers’ also
if he had required it.</p>

<p>“The narrow or the broad, sir?” said Mr. Thomas
Ling.</p>

<p>“The broad,” said the heir to the barony; but at Mr.
Thomas Ling’s look of frank incredulity, he corrected it
to “the narrow.”</p>

<p>Armed with the narrow, the heir to the barony left
the shop of Mr. Thomas Ling poorer by the sum of
five and sixpence, and also by a box of the best assorted
chocolates from B. Venoist which he had the misfortune
to leave upon the counter.</p>

<p>“Cross as two sticks,” muttered the stricken young
man as he reached the very end of the celebrated thoroughfare,
and gazed an instant into the window of
Messrs. Wan &amp; Sedgar to see how their famous annual
winter sale was getting on in the absence of the winter.</p>

<p>The mind of the heir to the barony hovered not unpleasantly,
for all its unhappiness, over a peculiarly
chaste display of silk and woolen pajamas, three pairs
for two guineas, guaranteed unshrinkable, when with a
shock he awoke to the fact that he was no longer the
proud possessor of a box of the best assorted chocolates
from B. Venoist.</p>

<p>“I’m all to pieces this mornin’,” registered the vain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>young man on the inner tablets of his nature. Thereupon
he took out his watch, a gold hunting repeater, a
present from his mother when he came of age, and in a
succinct form apostrophized his Maker.</p>

<p>“My God! nine minutes to one and I’ve got to collect
the kids from Eaton Place and the bally show begins
at one-thirty. Here, I say!”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony hailed a passing taxi.</p>

<p>“Call at Ling’s up on the right, and then drive like
the devil to 300 Eaton Place.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, sir,” said the driver of the taxi, in
such flagrant contravention of the spirit of the Public
Vehicles Act 9 Edwardus VII Cap III that we much
regret being unable to remember his number.</p>

<p>It was the work of two minutes for the heir to the barony
to retrieve the box of best assorted chocolates from
the custody of Mr. Thomas Ling up on the right, and
then the driver of the taxi sat down in the saddle and was
just proceeding to let her out a bit, in accordance with
instructions, when Constable X held him up peremptorily
at the point where Bond Street converges upon B.
Venoist. Not, however, we are sorry to say, in order
to take the number of this wicked chauffeur, engaged
in breaking an Act of Parliament for purposes of private
emolument, but merely to enable an old lady in a
stole of black mink and a black hat with white trimmings,
together with a Pekinese sleeve dog, lately the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>property of the Empress of China, to cross the street
and buy a box of water colors for her youngest nephew.</p>

<p>Certainly she was a very dear old lady; but the heir
to the barony cursed her bitterly, as, gold hunting repeater
in hand, he vowed that the kids would not be in
time for the rising of the curtain. Part of his blame
overflowed upon the head of Constable X; and we ourselves
concur in this, because we certainly think that, if
stop the traffic he must, it behooved him, as the appointed
guardian of the public peace, to take the number
of this guilty chauffeur.</p>

<p>As it was, the driver of the taxi, owing to this dereliction
of duty upon the part of Constable X&mdash;a kind
man certainly, and about to become a sergeant&mdash;sat
down again in the saddle and proceeded to let her out a
bit further. So that anon, swinging along that perilous
place where four-and-twenty metropolitan ways
converge, yclept Hyde Park Corner, he came within an
ace of running down a perfectly blameless young man
in an old bowler hat and a reach-me-down, the author
of this narrative, who was on his way to consult with
his respected publisher as to whether a work of ripe
philosophy would do as well in the autumn as in the
spring.</p>

<p>The young man in the old bowler hat&mdash;old but good
of its kind, purchased of Mr. Lock in the street of
Saint James on the strength of “the success of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>spring season” (for the reach-me-down no defense is
offered)&mdash;the young man in the old bowler hat stepped
back on to the pavement with as much agility as an old
footballer’s knee would permit, and cursed the occupant
of the taxi by all his gods for a bloated plutocrat, and
in the unworthy spirit of revenge vowed to make him the
hero of his very next novel.</p>

<p>A cruel revenge, but not, we think, unjustified. Idle
rich young fellow&mdash;toiled not, neither did he spin&mdash;nursing
a gold hunting repeater in a coat with an astrachan
collar and one of Messrs. Scott’s latest&mdash;with
a red face and a suspicion of fur upon the upper lip&mdash;taking
five kids who had lost their mother to the pantomime
without his lunch&mdash;how dare he run down a true
pillar of democracy at the rate of thirty-five miles an
hour!</p>

<p>At nine minutes past one by the gold hunting repeater,
in the middle of Victoria Street, the hard thought
occurred to the young man that he would get no lunch.
Still, let us not overdo our regard for his heroism. He
had not finished his breakfast until something after
eleven, and his breakfast had consisted of three devilled
kidneys on toast, a plate of porridge, a grilled sole,
muffins, marmalade and fruit <i>ad libitum</i>, but still the
young chap was undoubtedly going to miss his luncheon.</p>

<p>At twelve minutes past one by the gold hunting repeater,
the heir to the barony was acclaimed in triumph
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>from the threshold of Number 300 Eaton Place by
five kids and their nannas, who were beginning almost to
fear that Uncle Phil had forgotten to call for ’em.</p>

<p>“It is only Aunty Cathy that forgets,” said Marge,
who, considering that at present she is only five, has excellent
powers of observation. “Uncle Phil never forgets
nothink.”</p>

<p>Shrill cheers greeted the idle, rich young fellow.
Blow, blow thy whistle, Butler. Let us have another
taxi up at once. Marge and Timothy and Alice Clara
in taxi the first with Uncle Phil; Nannas Helen and Lucy
with Dick and the Babe in taxi the second.</p>

<p>“Must be at Drury Lane,” said Uncle Phil to Messieurs
les Chauffeurs, “before the risin’ of the curtain
at one-thirty.”</p>

<p>Those grim evil-doers nodded darkly, and away they
tootle-tootled round the corner into the Buckingham
Palace Road. One fourteen, said the gold hunting repeater.
Bar accidents, we shall do it on our heads.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Phil,” said Marge, “we’ve forgotten
Daddy.”</p>

AND LUCY NANNA, AND WE HOPE YOU’LL<br />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door of Marge’s taxi was opened by a benevolent
bewhiskered policeman, who, being himself a family
man, lifted her out as if he was pleased to see her.
Uncle Phil then handed out Timothy and Alice Clara;
and then he got out himself and performed an action
which we are forced to view with regret. He opened
the little purse which he kept in the pocket opposite to
the gold hunting repeater, and presented a whole “bar”
to the member of the criminal classes whose number we
have so unfortunately omitted to take. And that dark-visaged
misdemeanant, who, if every man had had his
due would have had the blood of half the West End of
London on what he was pleased to call his conscience,
spat for luck on his guilty emolument when no one was
looking, and thought of the new hat he would be able to
buy the missus. At least we hope he did, although Mr.
G-lsw-rthy rather has his doubts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>Shoals of other kids were converging upon the portals
of Drury; kids in taxis, kids in growlers, kids on
foot. It was 1:28, and all were frightfully anxious to
be in their places by the time the curtain&mdash;the real, not
the fireproof curtain&mdash;went up. Timothy and Alice
Clara were inclined to hustle round a bit, but Marge had
such implicit faith in Uncle Phil that to her mind hustling
was not called for and was therefore unladylike.</p>

<p>In justice to Marge, it is only fair to say that her
faith in Uncle Phil was justified. Crowds of arrivals
were in the vestibules; kids with their fathers, kids with
their mothers, kids with their nannas, kids with their
maiden aunts. But straight as a die Uncle Phil cut out
a course for his convoy. In double file his party of
seven&mdash;five kids and two quite nice-looking nannas&mdash;followed
in the wake of his astrachan collar and whanghee
cane with silver mountings. At 1:29 Marge was
seated in Box B, next to the stage and on a level with
the dress circle. Timothy and Alice Clara and Dick
and the Babe were seated beside her&mdash;certainly a great
triumph for all concerned, including the criminal eating
his dinner out of his handkerchief within a stone’s throw
of the editorial office of the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>Uncle Phil bought a programme and paid a shilling
for it, although sixpence was the price.</p>

<p>“Cinderella, I see. Rippin’.”</p>

<p>Marge knew it was Cinderella. She had dreamed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>that it was. Besides all the best pantomimes are Cinderella.
But where was Daddy? Why didn’t he make
haste? There was Mr. Lover&mdash;loud applause&mdash;the
orchestra was tuning up. Oh, why didn’t Daddy&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, joy! Oh, providence! Daddy came into Box B
just as Marge was inquiring for him, in his tall hat,
fresh from Mincing Lane. A rather tired and sad-looking
Daddy, a little hollow in the cheeks and with
rings under his eyes, although fortunately Marge didn’t
notice them. But as soon as he caught sight of the
heir to the barony, which his other name is Uncle Phil,
a smile seemed to come right over him.</p>

<p>“Damned good of you, old boy,” he said, as he hung
up his tall hat beside the very latest performance on the
part of Messrs. Scott. “Ungodly hour to begin,” said
Daddy. “Hope you got your lunch all right.”</p>

<p>“Ra-<i>ther</i>,” said Uncle Phil. “You?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye-es.”</p>

<p>We know what Uncle Phil is, and we are afraid we
must say the same of Father.</p>

<p>But Mr. Lover is already under way with his overture.</p>

<p>And then Father asked Marge if she could see, and
if Timothy could see, and was the Babe comfortable,
and other well-meaning but superfluous questions, almost
as it were to convey a sense of his importance. And
there was the curtain actually going up, on a field of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>new-mown hay. It was magnificent, but, with all respect
to Mr. Hollins, the scent of the hay was only just able
to get across the footlights. But don’t let Mr. Hollins
take it to heart, because Marge, quite one of the most
important people in all his noble theater, was able to
smell the scent of the new-mown hay all right.</p>

<p>“A toppin’ good chorus,” said Uncle Phil.</p>

<p>Put that plume in your cap, Mr. Hollins, because no
young man of his years in London has had more theatrical
experience than the heir to the barony. So
lately as the Monday previous he had made his forty-sixth
appearance at <i>Our Miss Gibbs</i>. Hunting chorus,
too, though what the followers of the chase were
doing in a field of new-mown hay&mdash;but after all, what’s
the use of being in Arcady if you can’t have things exactly
as you want ’em?</p>

<p>Dick and the Babe fairly crowed with pleasure.
Helen Nanna hoped they would restrain themselves, and
whispered to Lucy Nanna that <i>never</i> had she seen anything
like it. And while she was whispering this truth
to Lucy Nanna there came a roar from the house, and
an oldish, middle-aged person sauntered into the field
of new-mown hay, immediately tripped over herself, and
assured all whom it might concern that she was a perfect
lady. She then proceeded to sing a song about a gentleman
of the name of Kelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The enthusiasm that was caused by her song and behavior
would be vain to describe.</p>

<p>“Chap’s a genius,” said Father. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Wilkie Bard, of course,” said Uncle Phil.</p>

<p>“Has anybody here seen Kelly?” inquired the old
lady. It appeared that every single person there, including
the occupants of Box B, either had seen or hoped
to see Kelly.</p>

<p>And then quite suddenly the lights went out, the orchestra
rolled in semi-darkness, something happened to
the scenery, the lights went up again, and there was a
kitchen in the ancestral halls of Baron de No-Cash.</p>

<p>Again crowed the Babe with pleasure, and he had a
perfect right to do so; because it was really a remarkable
sort of a kitchen, larger by far than the one in
Eaton Place where cook kept the marmalade; though,
doubtless, what most intrigued the fancy of the Babe was
the enormous fireplace which had accommodation for a
turnspit and at least twenty-four persons.</p>

<p>In the temporary absence of any single human individual
the turnspit had the stage all to itself. This was
a subtle device on the part of the management. An air
of rapt expectation enfolded the great audience, as of
something going to happen.</p>

<p>And something did.</p>

<p>A perfect roar of enthusiasm heralded the happening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of the something. Now what do you suppose it
was? Nothing less than the arrival of the Principal
Girl.</p>

<p>She just wandered in, no-how as it were, with a broom
in her hand and her skirt in tatters, and a red cap over
her curls and her feet in slippers. She was merely the
maid of all work in the kitchen of the Baron de No-Cash,
a downtrodden creature according to legend and
according to the libretto, but you would hardly have
thought so, since she had to stand bowing for two whole
minutes over her broom handle before she was allowed
to proceed with the business of life.</p>

<p>The roar reverberated from the roof of the gallery
to the floor of the pit. Kids in boxes, kids in stalls,
kids in the dress circle, and an infant in arms at the
back of the pit all did their best; and responsible middle-aged
gentlemen from the Kaffir Circus and the Rubber
Market, a grandee from the Home Department, a judge
of the Court of King’s Bench, a solicitor who had
applied the money of his clients to his own purposes,
although nobody had found him out at present, a substantial
family from Hammersmith, the proprietor of
a flourishing Brixton laundry, whose eldest girl was in
the ballet, an old charwoman in the front row of the
gods, and a thousand and one other heterogeneous elements
whom we are only able to refer to in the most
general terms, assisted Marge and Timothy and Alice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Clara, and Dick and the Babe to make the welkin behave
frightfully foolish, over a rather plain-looking girl
of twenty-four who had to keep bowing over her broom
handle before she could get on with the business of life.</p>

<p>And when at last she was able to get on with the
business of life, what do you suppose it was? Why, to
sing, of course, “Come with me to Arcadee.” What in
the world else do you suppose her business in life
could be?</p>

<p>A little well-timed assistance from Mr. Lover, which
she really didn’t require, and away she soared straight
up through the middle register, and at the same moment
something seemed to go ping, ping, beneath the knitted
waistcoat of chocolate worsted of the heir to the barony,
standing at the back of Box B by the side of Father.</p>

<p>“Come with me to Arcadee.”</p>

<p>Uncle Phil accepted her invitation without the slightest
hesitation&mdash;we are not so sure as we should like to
be about Father&mdash;but Nannas Helen and Lucy, and
Marge and the rest of ’em, indeed an overwhelming
majority of that crowded and representative assembly,
went straight to Arcadee with that rather plain young
woman who was suffering from a cold in the head.</p>

<p>We call her plain as much out of deference to Mr.
G-lsw-rthy, and Mr. H. G. W-lls and Mr. Arnold
B-nn-tt as any other reason we can think of. Because
in the opinion of the heir to the barony she was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
enshrined as “a nailer,” and no girl absolutely
and unmistakably plain could possibly have been
granted the highest of all diplomas by one of such a
ripe experience of all phases and degrees of womanhood.</p>

<p>No, Mr. G-lsw-rthy, perhaps not a patrician beauty,
like the daughter of whom we wot, still <i>plain</i> is not the
word exactly. Can you call any young woman plain,
who, attired in her nondescript manner, hypnotizes the
whole of Drury with her tiny handkerchief edged with
lace, every time she plucks it out of her tatterdemalia?</p>

<p>Plain?&mdash;no, sir, decidedly not. A plain girl could
never hypnotize the whole of Drury with her handkerchief,
including an austere old gentleman in the second
row of the stalls, allowing a question of taxed costs to
stand over till the following Tuesday. Plain, Mr.
G-lsw-rthy!&mdash;we at least, and the heir to the barony
are forced to dissent.</p>

<p>“She’s a nailer. What’s her name?” said Uncle
Phil.</p>

<p>Father lowered his sombre eyes, and shook his head
at Uncle Philip. He had not gone to Arcadee with the
Principal Girl, you see. Upon a day another Principal
Girl had lured him thither, and Father had had to come
back again, and Father was feeling that he wanted never
to go any more to Arcadee&mdash;except with the Principal,
Principal Girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Helen Nanna, a good, kind girl and high up in the
class at Old Dame Nature’s Select Academy for Young
Ladies, handed the programme to Uncle Philip, who perused
the same as soon as the vibrations under the chocolate
waistcoat would allow him to do so.</p>

<p>“Birdie Brightwing&mdash;no, she’s Prince Charming,
and this is Cinderella. Mary Caspar is Cinderella.”</p>

<p>Uncle Philip, for all his ripe experience, had never
heard of Miss Caspar, and Father hadn’t either. Never
been seen at the Gaiety or the Lyric. No wonder a star
had had to be placed by the Management opposite the
name of Miss Caspar to denote an explanatory footnote
at the bottom of the programme.</p>

<p>“By special arrangement with the Royal Italian
Opera House, Blackhampton.”</p>

<p>Ha! that explained it. Deep minds were in this.
Merely one more stroke of genius on the part of Mr.
Hollins. When Florence de Vere had broken her engagement
at the eleventh hour in order to take part in
the Beauchamp Season, to the dismay of all that was
best in the life of the metropolis, what did Mr. Hollins
do? Sit down and twiddle his thumbs, did he? Not
so, my masters. He called for his coat with the beaver
collar, and his new bowler hat from Mr. Lock, and he
took a first-class ticket for the Royal Italian Opera
House, Blackhampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“Not for the King of England, not me,” said the
Lessee and Manager haughtily. “We open on Boxin’
Night with <i>Aladdin</i>, and the bills are printed.”</p>

<p>Oh, vain Lessee! Little he recked of the Napoleonic
faculty of Mr. Hollins in combination with his cheque-book.
Meetings of indignation were held in Blackhampton
and its environs, but after all, the loss of the
famous midland city was the gain of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>Miss Caspar had come, had been seen, had overcome.</p>

<p>“’Core!” roared the bloods in the stalls.</p>

<p>“’Core!” echoed the cads in the pit.</p>

<p>“’Core!” cried the young ladies in the dress circle.</p>

<p>“’Core!” yelled the members of nature’s nobility,
cheek by jowl with the magnificent ceiling.</p>

<p>Mary Caspar’s cold was really frightful, but she
couldn’t help herself, poor girl. Once more she took
’em all to Arcadee&mdash;Marge and Timothy and Alice
Clara and Dick and the Babe and Helen and Lucy
Nanna and certainly Uncle Phil. As for poor Father,
he leaned back against the wall with his hands in his
pockets, and almost wished he hadn’t come. There was
something about that girl taking ’em all to Arcadee
that somehow&mdash;no, dash it all, he must learn to keep
that upper lip a bit stiffer.</p>

<p>“’Core!” shouted Father&mdash;but so feebly that nobody
heard him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Only a hundred a week,” said Mr. Hollins in the ear
of the Chairman of the Syndicate in the box below.
“Dirt cheap.”</p>

<p>“Sign her for five years at double the salary,” said
the Chairman of the Syndicate in the ear of the famous
manager.</p>

<p>“Nothing like a provincial training,” said Mr. Hollins.
“Teaches ’em how to get right home to the heart
of the people.”</p>

<p>“’Core!” roared the Chairman of the Syndicate.</p>

<p>“Absolute nailer,” said Uncle Phil.</p>

<p>And then her acting! It was so perfectly easy and
natural that it really didn’t seem like acting at all. Her
speaking voice, for all that it hurt her so, was clear and
low and quite agreeable; and wiser men than Uncle
Phil have thought that such a voice as that is the greatest
charm in any young woman. Not quite so ultra-refined
perhaps as that of the seventh unmarried daughter
of not quite a hundred earls; not quite so much
torture was inflicted upon the letter “o,” that honest
vocable. Icy tones had been Adela’s that morning in
the opinion of the heir to the barony; those of the
new-risen star of Blackhampton were clear and unaffected
and ringing with human sympathy. No wonder
that the sensitive mechanism behind the chocolate waistcoat
was thrown clean out of gear.</p>

<p>She acted beautifully that fine scene inside the fireplace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
with a nondescript entity, by the name of Buttons,
which his proper name is Mr. Graves and a man of
genius; acted it beautifully during the time her wicked
sisters had left her at home to work like a menial while
they had gone to the Prince Charming’s ball.</p>

<p>After the Principal Girl had sung another ballad, to
the entire satisfaction of all that was best in the life of
the metropolis, the great and good Mr. Lover handed
up to her a noble box of chocolates from an unknown
friend in front.</p>

<p>The appearance of this rare box of chocolates struck
the heir to the barony with deep dismay. What had
happened to the ill-fated box he had bought of B. Venoist!</p>

<p>“I’m hanged,” he said, “if I haven’t left that bally
box in the taxi after all!”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony waited until the Principal
Girl had retired to get into her famous glass slippers
and her ballroom kit, and then like a thief in the night
he stole out of Box B, that none should see him go, and
crept round the back of the dress circle to the refreshment
buffet presided over by a Hebe of three-and-forty
summers in an outfit of yellow curls.</p>

<p>He would never be able to forgive himself if the kids
should think he had forgotten those chocolates.</p>

<p>“Price o’ those?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The heir to the barony disbursed the sum with his accustomed
munificence.</p>

<p>“Hullo, young feller, what are you doing <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p>This question was asked by a gentleman of prosperous
appearance who was holding up a yellow fluid
in a tiny glass and looking as though he might presently
imbibe it.</p>

<p>“Party o’ kids,” said the heir to the barony. “Toppin’
good show.”</p>

<p>The gentleman of the prosperous appearance quite
agreed and invited him civilly to drink.</p>

<p>“Must get back with this,” said the heir to the barony,
holding up a very fine performance on the part of
good Messrs. Cadbury.</p>

<p>Although the heir to the barony stayed not to partake
of liquid refreshment at the expense of the gentleman
at the buffet, and rightly so, we think, having regard
to the tragedy of B. Venoist, yet the latter, who
was engaged in recruiting exhausted nature with a
sherry and angostura bitters, was one of the most distinguished
men throughout the length and breadth of the
metropolis. Arminius Wingrove was the name of him;
a man of consequence to this narrative as to many
another one; envied by some, yet esteemed by all who
knew him, inasmuch as he was one of the leading
dramatic authors of the period. More of him anon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>But please to remember, when the time arrives, that you
have already had the honor of a formal introduction to
Arminius Wingrove.</p>

<p>The slave of duty stole back to Box B, and his reappearance
with the signal triumph of Messrs. Cadbury
went entirely unmarked, his luck being such that he
crept in at the moment the Fairy Godmother waved her
wand, and the rats and mice, not to mention the lizards,
became piebald ponies who bore off Cinderella in her
state chariot to the Prince’s Ball.</p>

<p>Helen and Lucy Nanna had never seen anything like
it&mdash;never; the Babe crowed with pleasure; Marge and
Timothy and Alice Clara could merely gasp; and Father
confided to Uncle Phil in a sombre undertone that it was
the best pantomime he had seen for years.</p>

<p>We give Mr. Hollins our grateful and cordial meed
for Part I of his noble annual production, what time
the fire-proof curtain falls upon salvos of wild applause,
in order that the ladies of the ballet may change
their clothing, and the orchestra may remove the froth
from a pint of bitter, and Mary Caspar, brave girl and
true-blue she-Briton, every inch of her, may drink a
much-needed cup of tea; while Marge and Timothy
and Alice Clara and Dick and the Babe and the rest of
’em obtain first hand information as to what that box is
that Uncle Phil has acquired by barter from good
Messieurs Cadburyee for the sum of three half-crowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Dick fancies the pink one. Can’t have it, because it
ain’t cricket for kids of three to take precedence of
grown-up ladies rising five. Pipe his eyes, does he?
Not so, my masters&mdash;the yellow one is just as agreeable
to Master Richard who will probably play for Middlesex
in after life. Timothy thinks that the one with
the walnuts on it&mdash;if Marge don’t mind. Marge don’t
mind, because there is another one with walnuts on it;
but even if it stood alone she’d say she didn’t, not that
there is any particular credit due to her, it simply being
that she’s kind of made like that.</p>

<p>Helen Nanna preferred the plain. She had never
tasted anything nicer. Lucy Nanna fancied the one
with the nougat in it. Daddy didn’t care for choc-o-lates.
As for Uncle Phil, the munificent donor who had
missed his luncheon, although no one knew it besides
himself, he took a peppermint warily, but found it quite
all right.</p>

<p>But there is the orchestra blaring like a giant refreshed
with wine; and in respect of the great Mr.
Lover this is no more than sober verity, since, at the instance
of a friend and admirer, he had been to interview
Hebe with yellow curls. Boomed and blared the cornets
to hail the reappearance of the ladies of the ballet,
in canary-colored stockings which had no clocks upon
’em. Austere old gentleman, second row of stalls, letting
question of taxed costs, etc., dived for opera
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>glasses, for which he had duly disbursed the fee of sixpence
as by law prescribed.</p>

<p>Ping went the clockwork under the chocolate waistcoat
of Uncle Philip. There she was again. What a
dream she was in her golden chariot with a diadem over
her chestnut curls. Bowed and kissed her hand to the
admiring multitude; stepped down from her chariot,
smiling, smiling in her royal manner at the footmen as
she passed them, and followed by all that was best in the
life of the metropolis as she crossed the threshold of the
Prince’s domicile.</p>

<p>Ping went the heart of Uncle Philip. Austere old
gentleman fumbled for his programme&mdash;dear old boy
lamenting his wretched memory for names. Bald-headed
light of the Chancery Bar unfolds his pince-nez;
outspoken youth in gallery roars out “<i>Good</i> on
yer, Mary!”</p>

<p>In our humble judgment outspoken youth was quite
correct. O ye Maries of England, you ought to be
proud of her! Trumpets blared, lights went out, transformation
to Fairyland, and there again was Mary!
Once again she was going to let the painter go.</p>

<p>O ye Maries of England, true heroism is not the
private perquisite of the Royal Horse Guards Blue.
The precious seed is in you all, my dears. May you
always do your respective duties as this particular Mary
did when England expects it of you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p>Right up she went through the middle register, tearing
her poor throat to pieces at every note she took.
Fairly launched the painter&mdash;“Nelson and his Gentlemen
in Blue.” Don’t know whose the words are&mdash;Swinburne
maybe, or Campbell Thomas, or Dibdin,
or Gilbert W. S.; music may have been by Brahms or
Schubert, or Strauss or Wagner or Debussy, but critics
of Leading Morning Journal seem to think by none of
these.</p>

<p>“’Core!” roared the cads in the stalls.</p>

<p>“’Core!” yelled the bloods in the pit.</p>

<p>“’Core!” cried the young ladies in the dress circle.</p>

<p>“’Core!” roared the members of nature’s nobility all
over the house.</p>

<p>“Right on the spot all the time,” said the Chairman
of the Syndicate. “Hollins, have that five years’ contract
put in hand at once.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” said Hollins, forgetting the degree
to which it had pleased providence to call him in the lilt
of that nautical tune.</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> on yer, Mary,” proclaimed outspoken youth
with almost pathetic enthusiasm from the front row of
the gods.</p>

<p>At the end of the twenty-fourth verse Mr. Lover presented
a bouquet of lilies of the valley, smilax and
maidenhair fern to this national heroine. Paid for by
the management, saith young friend of the <i>Standard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>News</i>. May be, young sir, but Marge waved frantically;
and the Babe crowed shrilly, and Uncle Philip
deplored the fact that he had not had the sense to bring
one himself.</p>

<p>We pray of your patience, gentles all, to retain your
seats until the Principal Girl has married the Prince.
She won’t be long now, that good, brave girl. How
she has done it we don’t quite know; and remember, people,
what British pluck has already done this afternoon,
British pluck will have to do all over again this evening.</p>

<p>“Girl ought to be in bed,” says Harley Street Physician
in box, opposite Box B, to old college friend the
house surgeon at Bart’s. “She’ll have a temperature
if she isn’t careful.”</p>

<p>“She’s given the house a temperature all right,” said
the house surgeon at Bart’s, mingling refined humor with
grave thoughts like the American judge at the funeral
of his mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Kids staying of course for the end of it all. Details
much too banal to inflict upon the overwrought patience
of the gentle reader. But Father and Uncle Phil,
lunchless and thirsty, patient and uncomplaining, though
bored to tears, stand as ever at the back of Box B,
at the post of duty. Whole-hoggers these upright citizens,
though one was the eldest son of a peer and the
other connected by marriage with several. But let justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
be done to ’em. They would see it all out to the
end, in order that Marge and Timothy and Alice Clara
and the Babe and Helen and Lucy Nanna should be
sent back in taxis to Number 300 Eaton Place, just
as they ought to be.</p>

<p>Father’s handicap was four at Prince’s, and he would
have much preferred to spend his only free afternoon
that week at Mitcham where the common is, and where
you can lose a golf ball about as soon as in any other
rural spot in Surrey. As for the heir to the barony,
as all the world doth know, his path as designed for him
that afternoon by the lady his mother, was the Queen’s
Hall by Portland Place&mdash;that temple of elevated and
serious energy, wherein Busoni had designed to charm&mdash;and
we hope he would be able to do so&mdash;the seventh
unmarried daughter of not quite a hundred earls.</p>

<p>Don’t think us forward, O ye Liberal organs of opinion,
for mentioning details so trite as these; but observe
that young plutocrat, that idle, rich young fellow,
with astrachan collar and whanghee cane, white spats by
Grant and Cockburn, bowler hat by Messrs. Scott&mdash;observe
him conducting that convoy of motherless kids and

father of ’em&mdash;and may he one day have five kids and
two quite nice-looking nannas of his own!&mdash;conducting
’em through kids in cloaks, kids in mufflers, kids in hats
and kids without ’em; through the seething vestibule of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>Drury, down the steps and round the corner; watch
him hail an honest but ill-favored, likewise a dishonest
but better favored, motor man. Watch him pack ’em
in and give directions, assisted by the unsought attentions
of a Distinguished Member of the Great Unwashed.</p>

<p>“Three hundred Eaton Place. Drive slowly.”</p>

<p>Oh, Irony!</p>

<p>Seeks to find a small piece of silver for the Great Unwashed.
Can discover four pence merely. Tempered
gratitude on part of Great Unwashed. A real Toff
never condescends beneath a tanner; and if he hasn’t
got one, why, what’s the matter with a bob?</p>

<p>“Time for a game of pills before dinner?” says the
heir to the barony.</p>

<p>“’Fraid there won’t be time, old boy,” says Father.
“Letters to attend to.”</p>

<p>“Time for a drink at the Betterton, anyhow,” says
Uncle Philip.</p>

<p>That temple of aristocratic Bohemia, at which monarchs
sup and which actor managers frequent, is in such
close proximity to Drury, that only plutocracy in its
most aggravated form would have called for a taxi in
order to get to it. But what can you expect, O ye
Liberal organs of opinion, from the heir to a Tory peerage!</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH WE DINE OUT IN GROSVENOR<br />
SQUARE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> sat down to write a letter, and Uncle Philip
smoked a cigarette in a meerschaum holder and read the
<i>Sporting Times</i>. But the unfortunate young man
could hardly bring his mind to bear upon those chaste
pink pages for all that the Dwarf and Mr. Pitcher were
quite at the top of their form this week.</p>

<p>Was it that his conscience hurt him? Fretting about
Busoni do you suppose? Wondering whether the seventh
unmarried daughter and the dearest mother had got
to Queen’s Hall unscathed, and had also managed to get
back again all right?</p>

<p>May have been so. If there is a doubt about it, conscientious
fellow is entitled to benefit thereby; but we
are bound to admit there is a doubt upon the subject.</p>

<p>And our reasons be these, lieges all and masterful
men. At twenty to seven, long before Father had finished
his letters, who should deign to enter the silence
room but the identical Arminius Wingrove, to whom the
gentle reader has already had the honor of a formal introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Ping went the heart of the heir to the barony. He
rose from his chair of russia leather, lately recovered
at the behest of the Committee, and trod softly across
the turkey carpet, old but good.</p>

<p>“Fathead,” said the heir to the barony&mdash;for this
coarse familiarity we can only offer the excuse that the
Great Man had always been Fathead to his familiars
since his Oxford days&mdash;“Fathead,” said the heir to the
barony, “I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Fathead almost looked as though he had no desire to
converse with the too-familiar groundling, being due to
take the Dowager Duchess of Bayswater to dine at the
Ritz Hotel.</p>

<p>But on all occasions Arminius knew how to assume the
air of the <i>bon camarade</i>.</p>

<p>“Fire away. Only five minutes. Dining old Polly
Bayswater at the Ritz.”</p>

<p>“More fool you,” said the profane young man.</p>

<p>Alas! that nothing is sacred to the helots of the Button
Club.</p>

<p>“Come into the smoking-room, where we can talk a
bit.”</p>

<p>“Five minutes only,” said Arminius Wingrove, fixing
his eyeglass with his accustomed air of mental
power.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony laid hold of the arm of the
famous dramatist, as though he didn’t intend to let it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>go; hustled him into a room adjoining, deposited him
in the emptiest corner, ordered two sherries and angostura
bitters, and straightway proceeded to show what
comes of spending Saturday afternoon in places licensed
by the Lord Chamberlain for stage performances.</p>

<p>“Do you know by any chance the girl who was Cinderella?”</p>

<p>Superfluous question to ask of Arminius Wingrove,
we can tell you that. Are you not aware that the
young person who played Cinderella had already captured
all that was best in the life of the metropolis?
What a question to ask Arminius Wingrove who knew
every man, woman, and infant phenomenon worthy of
regard, from Anna Maria, Duchess Dowager of Bayswater,
to the ticket inspector on the Vauxhall trams.</p>

<p>“Know her? Of course I know her. And it was I
who chose her first long-clothes for her.” At least the
air of bland surprise of Arminius Wingrove was open to
that interpretation, although, of course, modesty would
have restrained him from saying anything of the kind.
“Everybody knows her&mdash;<i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know she was famous,” said the heir to the
barony, limp as rags.</p>

<p>Arminius measured him in his naïveté, though not
with the naked eye.</p>

<p>“Absolute nailer,” said the heir to the barony.</p>

<p>All <i>vieux jeu</i> to Arminius W. Took out his watch&mdash;inset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
with jewels of rare variety&mdash;a present from&mdash;never
mind who, ye froward journalists.</p>

<p>“Ritz at eight. Polly will curse if kept waiting for
her meals.”</p>

<p>“Absolute nailer,” said the vain young man.
“Would like to meet her awfully if you can manage it
for me.”</p>

<p>Arminius Wingrove pondered some.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;ye-es,” said that great man.</p>

<p>“Thought perhaps?”</p>

<p>Arminius Wingrove pondered more.</p>

<p>“Must go&mdash;poor old Polly. But be at the Carlton
Monday at five.”</p>

<p>With suppressed, but deep and sincere, emotion the
heir to the barony wrung the bejeweled hand of Arminius
Wingrove. Never more would he pull his leg. Not a
bad chap; harmless very.</p>

<p>“Have another sherry?”</p>

<p>Nary.</p>

<p>Exit Arminius Wingrove to dress to take old Polly
to the Ritz Hotel. Let us hope his evenin’ will not be
as dull as in his heart of hearts he fears it will be; and
even if he is carried out a corpse at a quarter-past eleven
from that palatial building which is not so far from
Piccadilly, his dying thought must be that he perished
in the performance of a kind, considerate, and gentlemanly
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Not of course, my lords and gentlemen, that it was
the first he had performed by many.</p>

<p>The plutocrat was dining, too. With whom? inquires
Transatlantic Journalist. With his people, of course,
in Grosvenor Square. Not at all romantic. Wasn’t it,
though? Adela and her Pa were going, although Pa
never went anywhere since the rheumatism.</p>

<p>Nobody else; just <i>en famille</i>. Something in the air?
<i>Does</i> look rather like it, doesn’t it, Cousin? A little
previous perhaps; and it doesn’t do to be too previous,
even in modern journalism.</p>

<p>Dressed in the Albany in his tightest evening trousers
did this idle, rich young fellow; although the question
why he could not have performed that action under
the roof of his excellent parents at No. 88 Grosvenor
Square, the corner house, can only be answered on the
plain hypothesis that his uncle and aunts and other
collaterals had left him a great deal of money to play
with.</p>

<p>White waistcoat, of course; buttons mother o’ pearl;
tie by Mr. Thomas Ling; pomade by Truefitt for the
upper story. Even his man was proud of him. But
we grieve to relate that his reception at No. 88 Grosvenor
Square, the corner house, was not so cordial as it
might have been, considering that up to the time of
writing the life of this idle, rich young fellow was void
of serious blemishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>He could feel the frost even before he took off the
coat with the astrachan collar.</p>

<p>“Ought to keep a stove, Jenkins, in this hall during
the winter months.”</p>

<p>But that well-trained servitor looked solemnly down
his Wellington nose, because even he could perceive that
the temperature that was already up against Master
Philip had nothing whatever to do with the state of the
British climate.</p>

<p>“Lady Adela and his lordship ’ave been here a quarter
of a hower, sir.”</p>

<p>What! twenty past eight. O curst pantomime of
Drury! O curst vision in thy chestnut curls, that thou
shouldst annihilate time and space for a comparatively
recent creation&mdash;although a Tory one, happily!</p>

<p>“I look like getting it in the neck properly,” said
the vain young fellow for his personal private information;
and Mr. Jenkins, that well-trained servitor, who
heard him not, would yet have concurred had he happened
to do so.</p>

<p>Certainly this surmise was fairly accurate. Adela’s
gaze was very cool and level; her method of voice production
also enhanced her statuesque appearance.
Even her Pa looked the reverse of cordial, but that of
course, was rheumatism.</p>

<p><i>Such</i> a pity he had missed Busoni, said the good old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>Mater. <i>Dear</i> Adela had enjoyed the Second Rhapsodie
of Liszt <i>so</i> much.</p>

<p>Pa’s seventh daughter may have done so, but her
demeanor seemed rather to make a secret of the information.</p>

<p>Certainly have to take to Jaeger underclothing, now
that the frost had come at last. Shivered poor young
fellow, as he took in Adela in sequins, a frock he had
seen her in before.</p>

<p>Cross as two sticks. Oh, yes, a proper minx. If she
will go on like this, we shall really have to see about a
boor who will abuse her.</p>

<p>Pa talked high politics with First Baron: whether
it was merely fun of Wilhelm, or whether Wilhelm
<i>weally</i> meant it.</p>

<p>“We will keep our eyes upon him,” said these two
distinguished compeers of Mr. Harold Box.</p>

<p>“Dear Adela,” said the good old Mater, “don’t you
think that Elektra is quite the finest music that Wagner
has ever written?”</p>

<p>Dear Adela didn’t really know. In fact she didn’t
seem to care about Elektra, or about Busoni, or about
Sir Henry Wood. Seemed to think that salted almonds
and Burgundy were of more importance far, although
we are bound to say that we think dear Adela was wrong
in this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Of course it was up to Mr. Philip, as a man of birth
and education to have a word or two to say. But unluckily
for him, in the stress of his laudable ambition,
he suddenly slipped his bridle, and waltzed right into the
conversation.</p>

<p>It was not so much lack of tact as the act of destiny.
He could be as tactful as another previous to attending
this ill-fated matinée at Drury Lane; but since that
tragic action he was merely one more tempest-tossed
mortal&mdash;for all the <i>soigné</i> look he had&mdash;in the grim
toils of fate.</p>

<p>“I wish you <i>had</i> come, Adela, really,” said the vain
young man. “There was a girl there playing Cinderella!”</p>

<p>“<i>How</i> interesting,” said the good old Mater.</p>

<p>Adela nibbled a salted almond pensively.</p>

<p>“Absolute nailer,” said Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>“How <i>very</i> interesting. And Busoni’s first piece was
the overture to the polonaise by Chopin&mdash;quite classical,
of course, but so full of verve and charm.”</p>

<p>“Her name is Mary Caspar, and Teddy Clapham
hadn’t heard of her before.”</p>

<p>“What a strain it must be for those poor professionals.
It made one quite ill to watch Busoni. Poor
man got so excited, but a <i>polonaise</i> in such a <i>difficult</i>
form of music, one understands.”</p>

<p>“‘Nelson and his Boys in Blue’ was absolutely rippin’.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
I say, Mater, if you have some free afternoon,
Saturday or Wednesday, I should like you and Adela
to come and hear her sing it, awfully.”</p>

<p>“And Sir Henry Wood conducted so admirably,
didn’t he, Adela dear?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he is a good conductor,” said Adela.
“But music is so tiresome unless one happens to be
musical, and even then one is likely to be bored.”</p>

<p>“Ought to have come to Cinderella,” said Mr. Philip.
“Enjoyed it awfully, I’m sure. An absolute nailer. I
mean to go again.”</p>

<p>Even with a weight-for-age allowance for the tact,
the charm, and the urbanity of one of London’s leading
Constitutional hostesses, it would be idle to speak of
the evening as a great success. The good old Mater
did all that a brave woman and a devoted mother could
have done in the circumstances, but such was the atmospheric
pressure that at last she was obliged to ask the
butler whether anything had gone wrong with the ventilator
of the new fire grate, which she had always viewed
with suspicion from the moment it had been put in.</p>

<p>In the withdrawing-room the frost grew worse.</p>

<p>“I must really have my cloak,” said the mother of
the heir.</p>

<p>Vain to stir the fire; nought could uncongeal the atmosphere.
No, it was not one of your successes, Mater;
no use pretending, is it? Better face the facts, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>you are not to blame, my dear. From the first you have
acted in simple good faith, in accord with your excellent
Suffolk Colthurst instincts; and they are very safe
things to go by as a rule.</p>

<p>It was right and kind of you to help dear Adela to
take up the problem of a young man who had rather
more money than was good for him, and who would be
all the better for having a nice sensible girl to spend it
for him. And we are free to admit that Adela was
capable of making herself uncommonly useful in that
way if only she would have brought her mind to bear
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Please don’t jump to such hasty conclusions, says a
Feminine Reader at this point&mdash;alas! that we have so
few. When sir, you suggest that dear Adela was not
allowing her mind to bear upon the subject of Mr.
Philip, you merely prove how nearly human ignorance
of the crude masculine variety can come to the precipice
of a very unsafe conclusion.</p>

<p>The fact that dear Adela wore sequins, says this wise
lady, when she knew that Mr. Philip thought they did
not do justice to her charms, and the fact that she was
at pains to let him know that her afternoon at Queen’s
Hall had tired her so much that she now preferred salted
almonds to general conversation, should make it clear
to the meanest intelligence that dear Adela had a thinking
part. If, as you say, proceeds our mentor, this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>young man was an eldest son, and his evening clothes
suited him so very well&mdash;which, by the way, one rather
takes for granted in Grosvenor Square&mdash;it was just
as well perhaps for him to learn to come to heel at the
outset, so that both dear Adela and he might be saved
unnecessary trouble after Dr. Bridge had played Op. 9.</p>

<p>It is hard, concludes the wise lady, for human error of
the crude masculine variety to go much further than
yours has done, if for a moment you could allow your
deluded readers to imagine that a well-born girl could
treat with more than feigned indifference an educated
Englishman with a comfortable private fortune. Because
no well-born girl ever is indifferent to three addresses
and possibly a yacht, however much she may
appear to be so.</p>

<p>The morning following being Sunday, dear Adela
kept her bed till Monday instead of going to church.</p>

<p>“Where is the Pain?” said Sir Wotherspoon Ogle
Bart.</p>

<p>The rude girl snapped at him a little, although he
was such a very dear old Fellah, as Windsor Cassel used
to say. But he quite agreed that dining with dull people
was likely to overthrow a sensitive digestion; still
for the next twenty-four hours at any rate, she must
take nothing in the way of nourishment but peptonized
biscuits and desiccated milk.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip hardly missed her genial presence at St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>Sepulchre’s as much as he might have done perhaps.
Sitting with his mother only two rows off the chancel,
with his hair brushed back from his intellectual forehead,
he got wrong in the responses, couldn’t find the
psalms appointed for the Third Sunday, got mixed most
hopelessly over the order of the prayers. He allowed
his mind to wander in respect of those appointed for
the Royal Family; and when the Reverend Canon
Fearon, robed in full canonicals and a rather ritualistic
stole, came to grips with the Laws of Moses, the mind
of Mr. Philip as it envisaged him, saw a golden chariot
where other people saw a wooden pulpit merely, and
instead of an uncovered sconce of shining silver, a diadem
of chestnut curls.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip finally left the chancel with the good old
Mater leaning on his arm. She was in need of no assistance,
but it looked maternal. They took a short turn
in the park to find an appetite for luncheon, but Adela
wasn’t among the earnest throng of morning worshipers
a-walking there.</p>

<p>In spite of Adela’s absence from the sacred function,
Mr. Philip did himself quite well at luncheon, as he always
made rather a point of doing in the matter of his
meals. In the opinion of this natural philosopher, if
you have a good inner lining the crosses of this life are
easier to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Adela read the <i>Ladies’ Field</i> and nibbled at her biscuits
and toyed with her desiccated milk. But we shall
waste no sympathy upon her, she having snapped at
the Court Physician&mdash;such a very dear old Fellah, with
a delightful old-world manner, and a clinical thermometer
in the lining of his hat.</p>

<p>Where Mr. Philip spent the afternoon of Sunday is
not germane to the issue, but where he spent that of
Monday can be handed in as evidence if the Court is
quite agreeable.</p>

<p>At five o’clock on Monday, the heir to the barony
looked in at a resort of fashion that we almost blush
to mention. Youth and beauty in their various disguises
were also there. Some in mink and some in ermine,
some in frieze and some in velvet, some with clocks
upon their wrists, some with clocks upon their stockings,
some in paint and some in feathers, some in hobbles,
some without ’em, some in turquoise earrings, some
in pearls, some in mutch of sanguine hue, some in coalscuttle,
some in beehive and other arch creations; and
as east of Piccadilly the weather was really getting
rather chilly, all we hope, wearing Jaeger underclothing.</p>

<p>Ping went the heart of the heir to the barony as each
fresh arrival entered. Ping went the heart of Philip.
Ping, ping it went continuous, as the patent doors revolved
upon their hinges, and rank and fashion, youth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>and beauty swept proudly past commissionaires and
other quite unimportant people. But as late as 5:15
Arminius Wingrove hadn’t shown a feather.</p>

<p>A puss in every corner worrying buttered scones and
muffins with the aid of silver-plated forks. All across
the parquet, under palms and awnings, the latest things
by Paquin, toyed with their real old china teacups,
and coquetted with toast and bread, butter and Monsieur
Eschoffier’s most delightful comfit cakes.</p>

<p>Ping went the heart of the heir to the barony; ping
went the heart of Philip; but although the strain upon
that important organ was terrific, Arminius Wingrove
never showed a feather.</p>

<p>The Blue Bulgarian Bazoukas discoursed really delightful
music; tunes by Strauss and tunes by Wagner,
oratorio by Monckton, masterpiece by Rubens, chic
morsels by Debussy, rhapsodies by gentlemen whose
names are easier to spell in Russian, the latest expression
of the genius of German, things in Spanish, things
in French, Elgar and Villiers Stanford, Sullivan and Dr.
Parry, Leslie Stuart and the Abbé Liszt&mdash;but Arminius
Wingrove never showed a feather.</p>

<p>Actually the hour of six had struck. With a glance
of despair at the gold hunting repeater of infamous
memory, the unhappy young man, for the good of the
house, peremptorily ordered a glass of water and a
toothpick. Already the motley throng of muffin-worriers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
replete with tea and cake and music, had begun to
take again to taxis, and to pair-horse vehicles, with and
without cockades.</p>

<p>Now, what do you suppose had happened to Arminius?
His excuse, when ten days later it happened to be
forthcoming, was so comprehensive, that the dignity of
human nature calls for a special chapter in which to
unfold the same.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH WE DRINK TEA AGAIN AT THE<br />
CARLTON</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the simple fact that Arminius Wingrove had
forgotten all about it. Let us not be hasty in our
blame, however, since according to his <i>amende</i> to Mr.
Philip at least ten days after his breach of faith, he
made it clear that he was without any sort of stain.</p>

<p>The plain fact was, Arminius Wingrove had been
commanded at a moment’s notice to shoot at Burnham
Beeches with Windsor Cassel. Comes as a great surprise
to you, does it? Shouldn’t though. Because,
when Lord Grey de Stilton caught a chill on the liver
through standin’ on damp grass, and had to turn it
up at a moment’s notice under the best medical advice,
who was there else to send for but England’s handy
man?</p>

<p>Poor idle rich young fellow had to chew dust and
practice the complete art of humility. When next they
encountered at the Betterton, ten days after this event,
and the vain young man, not yet in possession of this information,
ventured to reproach Arminius familiarly,
by name, that most distinguished man fixed his eyeglass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
with his accustomed air of mental power, and as
good as asked the heir to the barony, whose career at
present was not, who the dev-vil he was a-talkin’ to.
Not in so many words, perhaps, but it almost sounded
like it.</p>

<p>“You are a rotter&mdash;so you are&mdash;to go back on
your word like that. You promised to be at the Carlton
last Monday week, and you never showed a feather.
And it’s no use sayin’ that you did, because I waited an
hour and a quarter for you.”</p>

<p>Arminius transfixed the poor unintellectual, though
not with the naked eye.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> haven’t been to Windsor.” Arminius removed
his hat in his loyal mannah. “<i>You</i> don’t know the
Cassel.”</p>

<p>Poor young upstart took it in the neck terrific.</p>

<p>“Telephone or send a wire? Only just time to pack
my bag and then damn near had to have a special. I
feel obliged to chastise you, you cub, for this display
of eg-o-tism.”</p>

<p>The luckless heir groveled and begged pardon. Supposed
the affairs of the Empire must always take precedence
of a muffin-worry, even if the fairest of her sex
was going to be there. He had a Constitutional mind,
you see, even if the facts of his life are all against him.</p>

<p>“But I’ll overlook it this time,” said Arminius with
an air of really princely magnanimity, “if in the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
you will try not to overrate yourself, and you will
also promise not to be so cursed familiar in mixed company.
One don’t mind so much in this Bohemian resort,
but when I as a dinner guest meet you as one
of the mob at the Blenheims I particularly hope you
will not address me as Fathead before all the congregation.”</p>

<p>Deep shame overflowed the blonde complexion of the
heir.</p>

<p>“You’ve been asking for it a long time,” said Arminius
grimly, “and you’ve got it now. Cheek I abhor
from a new creation. But as I like you pooty well, I
am going to forgive you.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was only too glad to be forgiven
on these terms by such a distinguished man; and
in this, although we may lay ourselves open to correction,
we consider him quite right.</p>

<p>He could not sleep just now, you know, when he went
to bed at night. A rare vision enthralled him when he
dined, and when he supped; playing at billiards under
the guidance of Mr. John R-b-rts; losing at games of
chance, money he had never earned; riding in the park
with Adela, who had recovered of her indisposition, had
been to High Cliff, and had come back again; going with
his mother to concerts and museums like a dutiful young
chap; buying cigarettes at Harrod’s Stores; shaving in
the morning with his safety razor or pulling off his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>socks at night&mdash;his only thought was Cinderella and
her diadem of chestnut curls.</p>

<p>He had been several times in front to see her, but he
didn’t know Mr. Hollins anything like well enough to
dare to go behind. And not one of his many friends
in the metropolis seemed able and willing to bring him
closer to his divinity, with the sole and august exception
of Arminius Wingrove.</p>

<p>That is why perhaps the young man ate humble pie
<i>ad. lib.</i></p>

<p>“I’ve only one afternoon free this month, and that’s
to-morrah,” said Arminius.</p>

<p>Most unfortunate, but it happened that on the morrow
the vain young fellow was booked to take Adela
and her Cousin Jane from Cumberland, to drink tea at
Claridges’.</p>

<p>“Just as you like,” said Arminius Wingrove. “My
only afternoon.”</p>

<p>The young man knitted his brow in grave perplexity.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I could persuade Adela to turn up the
other shop and come to the Carlton. It isn’t quite
playing the game though, is it?&mdash;and she mustn’t know
what for, because if she does I’m bound to get it.”</p>

<p>So supremely bored looked Arminius in the stress of
these parochial affairs, that like a wise young fellow
the heir to the barony decided to curtail them somewhat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be there at five to-morrow, Fat&mdash;I should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>say Minnie. Carlton is quite as expensive as the other
box, although the crush is greater. You know Adela
Rocklaw, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Met her at High Cliff,” said Arminius casual-like.
“Old Warlock’s daughter. Girl you are engaged to.”</p>

<p>“Not engaged exactly.”</p>

<p>“Thought you were.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. Not official yet.”</p>

<p>“Time it was then,” said Arminius, with magisterial
gravity. “Just the girl for you.”</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>Life itself is a great perhaps says&mdash;no, there hardly
seems sufficient provocation to fix the blame upon any
private individual for his venerable saw. But all the
same, <i>peut-être</i> is perhaps the most important word in
any tongue.</p>

<p>The morrow at the hour appointed brought forth the
vain young fellow with Adela looking very smart, and
Cousin Jane from Cumberland looking rather the reverse
of fashionable. Precautions had been taken to
book a comfortable table in a sequestered angle, where
the Blue Bulgarian Bazoukas would be unable to wreck
any conversation that might happen to be forthcoming.</p>

<p>The heir was feeling all to pieces, and Adela, as usual,
was not so very gay. She had said Claridges’ distinctly.
Why had he not obeyed instructions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Five <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> but never a sign of Arminius Wingrove.
But even the heir to the barony, with that sinking sensation
behind his waistcoat, as he ordered tea and muffins
for three persons, was man of the world enough to
be aware that Arminius mightn’t appear very much before
the hour of six had tolled. He was beginning
slowly to realize that individuals so humble as himself
had meekly to hoard any small portions of the loaf of
human amenity that were cast upon the waters.</p>

<p>Indeed, the odds were six to four on that Arminius
would either forget this little engagement for the second
time, or that he would be again commanded to the
Cassel, his keen sense of hu-mor having, according to
ru-mor, made an e-nor-mous impres-sion. But even if
calamity again overtook the heir to the barony it was by
no means clear that he was going to grieve. For a
fortnight past, asleep and awake, had he dreamed of
Cinderella, but the gallant sportsman was feeling rather
cheap just now, as the young minx opposite, with the
cool blue eye and the chin of domination&mdash;’ware ’em,
you young bachelors&mdash;was engaged in giving him tea
without any sugar in it.</p>

<p>“What!” said the young cat.</p>

<p>They could hear her quite three tables away.</p>

<p>“A Mr. Wingrove. Says he’s met you. Thought
you wouldn’t mind meeting him again&mdash;awful brainy
feller&mdash;and he’s bringin’ a girl he knows.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>“What!” snarled the young puss, starting on her
first muffin.</p>

<p>Even poor Cousin Jane from Cumberland, who was
nearly twice the age of the young minx, got snubbed
most severely when she ventured some perfectly commonplace
remark. And such a nice, sensible girl as she
was.</p>

<p>“How do you spend your time in Cumberland?” said
the unfortunate heir, beginning to feel horribly cheap,
and wondering if he might venture upon a large whisky
and a small apollinaris.</p>

<p>“I hunt otters all the mornin’!” said the nice, sensible
Cousin Jane, “and in the evenin’ I gen’rally knit bed-socks.”</p>

<p>You must talk a little louder, please, now that the
Blue Bulgarian Bazoukas have opened fire upon that
magnificent 1812 Overture by Tchaikowski.</p>

<p>“How rippin’ they play, don’t they, Adela?” said
Cousin Jane from Cumberland. “So nice and loud.”</p>

<p>“What!” snarled the young minx above the strident
outcries of the Great Retreat.</p>

<p>“Rather makes you think of otter huntin’&mdash;just
when they begin the worry.”</p>

<p>The irresistible <i>élan</i> of the Blue Bulgarian Bazoukas
inspired Mr. Philip to an act of hardihood. Under
cover of the clamor, he hailed a passing waiter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<p>“Large whisky and small polly,” said the desperate
young man.</p>

<p>This classic beverage within him, he was once more
able to look the whole world in the eye. It was indeed
a happy inspiration, for hardly had his courage risen,
when at 5:27 by the hand of the clock among the greenery,
a most distinguished figure emerged through a host
of common persons and converged upon the scene.</p>

<p>Ping went the central organ of the young man’s being.
The hour and the man had come to hand. And ye
gods, there was Cinderella!</p>

<p>Retain your presence of mind, my lords and gentlemen,
the authentic heroine is coming to you, as fast as
her feet in very sensible number threes can bring her.
And her trim form is inhabiting a plain blue serge costume,
made by a very ordinary provincial tailor on very
reasonable terms, and her mighty sensible head is surmounted
by a <i>hat</i>, not a coalscuttle, nor a sauceboat, nor
a beehive, but a form of headgear well behind the fashion
two years ago in Manchester; and there is just a common
strip of fur round her throat, because the weather
east of Piccadilly is still blowing rather chilly, and she
has to sing this evening.</p>

<p>She is coming past the tables, whose critical occupants
are wondering why young ladies from the suburbs are
admitted to this Valhalla which holds all that is best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>and brightest in the metropolis. Not, of course, that
Arminius comes within the purview of this misdirected
criticism; his far-flung gaze surmounted by a noble topper,
astrachan collar inches deeper than the heir’s, white
spats by Grant and Cockburn, and a very snappy pair
of gloves.</p>

<p>The far-flung gaze of Arminius Wingrove has seen
the vacant places at the table, although he affecteth not
to notice ’em.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do, Lady Adela. When did you return
from High Cliff?”</p>

<p>Rude girl slowly raised a fin.</p>

<p>“Awful good of you, Fat&mdash;Minnie, I mean&mdash;old
boy.” The heir, stronger for his liquid sustenance,
spoke in tones of deep emotion. “Sit here, Miss Caspar,
won’t you? I know you are Miss Caspar, I’ve seen
you so often lately.”</p>

<p>General introductions, which even the best society
seems at present unable to dispense with.</p>

<p>Nice, sensible Cousin Jane from Cumberland smiled
so kind and pleasant, and thought they ought to have
more tea.</p>

<p>“And what’s your choice in cakes, Miss Caspar?”
said the young man brightly. “Scones or muffins or
some of those toppin’ things with sugar on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, anything’ll do for me,” said the Principal
Girl, as easy as if she was playing Cinderella. “No
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>fresh tea&mdash;quite warm and liquid. Just as I like it.
I’ll pour it out myself. No use offering tea to Mr.
Wingrove. A whisky and apollinaris, and&mdash;I didn’t
catch your name&mdash;hadn’t you better have another one
yourself?”</p>

<p>Oh, how rippin’! The heir to the barony was
wreathed in smiles. But the rude girl opposite stared
considerable at this simple spontaneity and natural ease
of bearing.</p>

<p>“Such a bore,” said Arminius. “Got to go to-morrah
to the Cassel. Daresay, Lady Adela, I shall meet
you there.”</p>

<p>“Papa is so poorly,” said the rude girl, thawing some.
“But, of course, Aunt Selina will explain it to the Cassel
as she is in waiting there just now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know Blackhampton?” said Cinderella.
“Oh, but you ought to know; it is every Englishman’s
duty to know Blackhampton. Dear, dirty old Blackhampton!”
said the Principal Girl. “The very best
town in England. You are always <i>sure</i> of your friends
in front when you play in Blackhampton.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony supposed it was so. Not in
any perfunctory spirit. How do you suppose the
young chap could be perfunctory with his divinity
drinking her tea, and eating Monsieur Eschoffier’s famous
comfit cakes as though she enjoyed them thoroughly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>
<p>Don’t let us heed the rude girl opposite. She is quite
safe in the competent hands of Arminius.</p>

<p>“Here’s your whisky and polly,” said the Principal
Girl; “and Mr. Wingrove’s, too. Better have some
more tea, I think. Miss Percival and Lady Adela are
going to have some to keep me company. Oh, yes,
<i>please</i>. And I say, waiter, have you any of those cakes
with currants in them, like you get at Blackhampton?”</p>

<p>The waiter said he would inquire.</p>

<p>Never mind the rude girl opposite; Arminius has her
in hand. With that chaste pair of yellow gloves and
his knowledge of the world, he will be able to manage
her, no doubt. A Miss Caspar&mdash;Drury Lane&mdash;going
far said those who knew&mdash;the Backinghams were taking
her up&mdash;the stock was bound to go higher. Sorry
that the stage had no interest for Lady Adela. Yes,
the Cassel was looking awfully well just now, in every
way quite its own bright and cheery Presence.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony said he had been to Blackhampton.</p>

<p>“Only once&mdash;but I’ve been there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how interesting!&mdash;to play for the Olympians
against Blackhampton Rovers&mdash;no&mdash;really&mdash;I didn’t
catch your name&mdash;why who <i>are</i> you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Shelmerdine,” said the heir to the barony,
as modestly as the circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;<i>the</i> Mr. Shelmerdine!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<p>If there was such a person as <i>the</i> Mr. Shelmerdine,
the heir to the barony feared it was a true bill.</p>

<p>Cinderella, with her provincial naïveté, didn’t know
that lords and people did such democratic things as
these.</p>

<p>“Do all sorts of wild things when you are up at the
’Varsity,” said the heir to the barony. “And, of course,
you know, that was before my guv’nor got his leg up.”</p>

<p>“Now it is no good your being modest, is it?” said
Cinderella. “Because I know all about you. It was
you who kicked those three goals against Scotland in
Nineteen Four.”</p>

<p>The confusion of the heir to the barony was dire.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of good your blushing, is it? I saw the
match&mdash;I was only a flapper then playing Fairy Footlight
at the Royal Caledonian, Glasgow, and I went
with my Aunt Bessie to Celtic Park, and saw you kick
three goals, and I won tons of chocolates off the Scotchies
in the Company, because I had put my pinafore on
old England, as I always have, and as I always shall&mdash;”</p>

<p>“&mdash;They say the new system of drainage at the
Cassel&mdash;”</p>

<p>“&mdash;Steve Bloomer himself couldn’t have done better
than you did that day&mdash;and it is no use your being
modest, is it?&mdash;”</p>

<p>“&mdash;And the Kaiser is one of the most charming and
well informed men I have ever&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“And so you are really the great Phil Shelmerdine,
with your hair brushed just as nice as ever. Even
when I was a flapper and wore a blue ribbon round my
pigtail, I used to think your hair was lovely. You
ought never to have left off playing socker; but I suppose
you kind of had to when Mr. Vandeleur made a
peer of your poor father. But England needs you
more than ever now that Steve is on the shelf.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you find the theater a very trying profession,
Miss Caspar?” said nice, sensible Cousin Jane
from Cumberland. “Aren’t the late hours a fearful
strain?”</p>

<p>“One sort of gets used to them,” said Cinderella.
“I’m as strong as a pony; and it’s great fun; and it is
wonderful how one gets to love the British public.”</p>

<p>“And how the British public gets to love you, Miss
Caspar&mdash;not, of course, that I mean that that is wonderful.”</p>

<p>Not so bad for a very dull young man. We only
hope the young fellow won’t get out of his depth, that’s
all.</p>

<p>“Oh, Homburg is the greatest bore of all.” The
seventh unmarried daughter suspended the story of her
sorrows to train a gaze of twenty-four candle-power
upon the heir.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget your Cinderella&mdash;and such a
cold as you had! But it seems to be better now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“The best way with a cold is to pretend you haven’t
got it.”</p>

<p>“And I shall always remember the way you sang
‘Arcadee,’ and ‘Nelson and his Gentlemen in Blue.’
We were in a box, you know, second tier on the left,
my friend Clapham and his five kids&mdash;lost their mother
last year&mdash;and their nannas. They simply howled
with joy. That little Marge is a nailer. I should like
you to see her, Miss Caspar, and when she grows up
she’ll be just like you.”</p>

<p>Miss Insolence opposite rose in the majesty of black
velvet and white ermine.</p>

<p>“Goo’-by.”</p>

<p>Arminius received a fin at an angle of sixty-five degrees.</p>

<p>“Jane.”</p>

<p>Cousin Jane was so glad to have met Miss Caspar,
and before she returned to Cumberland she hoped to
have the pleasure of seeing her play Cinderella.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m awfully proud to have met you, Miss Caspar.
And I hope you’ll bring some of your friends
along to the Albany, B4. My number on the telephone
is 059 Mayfair, and I’ll lay in a stock of cake.”</p>

<p>“Delighted!&mdash;and you must come and see us, me
and my old granny&mdash;Mrs. Cathcart&mdash;used to play
Lady Macbeth to John Peter Kendall and those old
swells, although I daresay you can hardly remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>them. But she’s a dear, Mr. Shelmerdine; and if you
want to hear about the dignity of the profession, and
how her granddaughter’s lowered it, come round to
Bedford Gardens, Number Ten, any Sunday afternoon,
and you’ll say she is the dearest old thing about.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH WE MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF<br />
THE GODDAUGHTER OF EDWARD BEAN</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Philip</span> counted the hours till Sunday came.
He was sorely infected now by the deadly virus.</p>

<p>As for those three goals against Scotland, he had
clean forgotten them. They were never mentioned in
his own little world. In Grosvenor Square, in particular,
no store was set by such irresponsible undergraduate
behavior. There his career only dated from the time
he had managed to get his commission rather easily in
the Second, and he had never been quite forgiven for
tiring of a respectable course of life so soon.</p>

<p>It was strange that this sportswoman, so full of sense
and pluck, had seen him in the crowded and glorious
hour when life was his in its fullness. He had lived in
those days, perhaps a little crudely, but now he wanted
to have done with his idleness and start to live again.</p>

<p>He was in love with Mary Caspar, and that was all
about it! Whether she drank tea at the Carlton or
warbled ditties on the boards of Drury, she rang tune
in every note. No wonder that she was the uncrowned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>queen of many a provincial city; no wonder that every
errand boy in the metropolis whistled “Nelson” and
“Arcadee.”</p>

<p>On his way to his rooms he called at a news-agent’s,
and invested a shilling in picture-postcards of Mary
Caspar.</p>

<p>“I suppose you sell a lot of these?”</p>

<p>“Hundreds,” said the young man behind the counter.
“We’ve sold out three times in a fortnight, and the demand
is increasing.”</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon, as five o’clock was striking
from St. Martin’s Church, Mr. Philip drove up to Bedford
Gardens and pulled the door bell of Number Ten.</p>

<p>A trim little parlor-maid led him up to a cozy little
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Miss Caspar received him with unaffected cordiality.</p>

<p>“And this is my Granny, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said
Cinderella proudly.</p>

<p>Grandmamma was a stately old dame in a turban,
turned eighty-four&mdash;a really wonderful old lady.
Her speech was lively and forcible; and her manner had
the grace of one who had grown old with dignity. It
had a half-humorous touch of grandeur also, as of one
who has known the great world from the inside, and is
not inclined to rate it above its value.</p>

<p>Grandmamma shook hands, and said she was glad to
meet the son of his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“A good and honorable and upright man I’m sure,
Mr. Shelmerdine, although his politics are all wrong to
my mind. You see, we artists, even the oldest of us,
live for ideas, and these unfortunate Vandeleurites&mdash;but
we won’t talk politics, although it was I who bought
Mr. Vandeleur his first bells and coral. At that time
nobody except his mother and myself, and possibly his
nurse foresaw that he was the future Prime Minister of
England. Polly, my dear, the tea.”</p>

<p>“You boastful old Granny,” said Mary. “And I
don’t think Mr. Shelmerdine is a bit impressed.”</p>

<p>“But I am&mdash;<i>awfully</i>,” said Mr. Shelmerdine gallantly,
handing the Bohea.</p>

<p>And he came within an ace of dropping the cup on to
the hearthrug, because Miss Mary chose at that fateful
moment to twitch her adorable left eyelid so artfully that
the young man had to whisk away his countenance to
keep from laughing in the face of Grandmamma.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, tell me, have you seen my granddaughter
play at the Lane?”</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Shelmerdine had, and if he might say so,
admired her playing awfully.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear you say that,” said Grandmamma.
“To my mind she displays a strange lack of
ambition. We are an old theatrical family, Mr. Shelmerdine.
When I was her age I was playing Lady
Macbeth to John Peter Kendall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>The young man was mightily interested, although
to be sure this was the first he had heard of John Peter
Kendall; but happily he had a useful sort of working
knowledge that <i>Lady Macbeth</i> was the name of a thrilling
drama by the author of <i>Money</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Mary was quite unscathed by this damaging
piece of criticism.</p>

<p>“Yes, Granny dear, but then you had genius&mdash;and
that’s a thing that doesn’t often occur in any family,
does it?”</p>

<p>“Mary child”&mdash;the natural grandeur showed a little&mdash;“it
is a mere <i>façon de parler</i> to speak of ambition,
respect for one’s calling, determination to live up
to the highest that is within oneself, as genius. Moreover,
the absence of genius is a poor excuse for lowering
the traditions of a distinguished family. Mr.
Shelmerdine, I hope you agree with me.”</p>

<p>Appealed to at point-blank range, the young man
was fain to agree with Grandmamma. But if his note
of conviction was not very robust, it must be remembered
that his present ambition was to run with the hare
and to hunt with the hounds.</p>

<p>“By taking pains,” said Grandmamma, “and showing
a proper reverence for its calling, even a modest
talent may add a cubit to its stature. That at least
was the opinion of John Peter Kendall and Mr. Macready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Shelmerdine cordially agreed with those great
men.</p>

<p>“To think of my granddaughter playing Cinderella
at the Lane when she should be playing Lady Macbeth
at His Majesty’s!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but ma’am,” said the young man, “she is a
nailin’ good Cinderella, you know.”</p>

<p>“A <i>nailing</i> good Cinderella, when her great-grandmother
played with Garrick, and one of her forebears
was in Shakespeare’s own company!”</p>

<p>The young man thought silence would be safer here.
Still, knightly conduct was undoubtedly called for.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t mind my sayin’, ma’am,” said he,
“that she’s the finest Cinderella I’ve ever&mdash;although
I daresay I oughtn’t to say it in her presence.”</p>

<p>But Grandmamma would admit no extenuating circumstance.
Mary was a disgrace.</p>

<p>“Well, dear Granny,” and again that wicked left
eyelid came into action, “you can’t deny that next year
the Lane is going to double my salary, although I am
sure I get quite enough as it is.”</p>

<p>“Child, do you suppose that John Peter Kendall
would have urged such an excuse?”</p>

<p>Grandmamma’s majesty dissolved Cinderella in light-hearted
mirth.</p>

<p>“I quite see your point, ma’am,” said the heir to the
barony, playing as well as he knew how.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine,” said the old lady, “I make you
my compliments on your good sense.”</p>

<p>It must certainly be said for the heir to the barony
that he made quite a favorable impression upon Grandmamma.
Rather a plume in the bonnet of the parfit,
gentil knight moreover; because as Granny had been
kissed by Mr. Dickens, used regularly to call upon Mr.
Thackeray in Young Street, had dined and supped
with Mr. Gladstone, and had a very poor opinion, indeed,
of Mr. Disraeli, she must be reckoned rather a judge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">A LITTLE LUNCH AT DIEUDONNÉ’S</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sore</span> were the ravages of the ancient malady. It
made it worse for the sufferer that he had never had it
before.</p>

<p>He was twenty-eight, a very healthy and normal citizen,
“a little slow in the uptake,” to be sure, but with
private means already, and the heir to the paternal
greatness. He should, of course, like other paladins,
have tried to keep out of mischief by serving his king
and country.</p>

<p>It was a mistake to have left the Second, said his admirable
parents. He wanted a wife, said all the world.
It was really necessary that a young man of his age
should provide himself with this most indispensable accessory.</p>

<p>In his torpid way he rather agreed. But he got no
forrarder, although it was perfectly clear that the indispensable
accessory was his for the asking.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had never exactly hit it off with Adela.
Self-willed and overbearing young women, doubtless, had
their reason to be; but he was much too shrewd a young
chap to crave to be tied up for life with one of them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>Still, if he wasn’t careful the fetters might easily be
riveted. Things had rather shaped that way for twelve
months past.</p>

<p>All the same, it behooved him to be wary. The fruit
was ripe. A single shake of the branch and it might
fall from the tree.</p>

<p>Cinderella had shaken the tree pretty severely. Simple,
kind and cheerful she was just the sort of girl you
could get on with. Straight as a die, overflowing with
life and sympathy, she had the noble faculty of being
genuinely interested in all the world and his wife.</p>

<p>Would she come out to lunch?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, any day except Wednesday and Saturday,
when she had to play.</p>

<p>So the very next morning they lunched at Dieudonné’s,
and everything seemed perilously pleasant.</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute! How delightful to have a
table in the corner! The restaurant of all others she
liked to lunch at; and lark and oyster pudding and
Chablis, the fare above all others that she coveted.</p>

<p>Comparisons are odious, but really...!</p>

<p>Didn’t he think Granny was wonderful? And really
<i>quite</i> great in her day. A link with the past, of whom
the profession was very proud.</p>

<p>Was Miss Caspar never tired of the theater? Wasn’t
it an awful grind? Didn’t she ever want a night off?
When she felt as cheap as she must have been feeling a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>fortnight ago last Saturday, didn’t she just want to
turn it up?</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;sometimes. But then her motto was Nelson’s,
never to know when you were beaten. It was
Nelson’s motto, wasn’t it? Besides, having two thousand
people in your pocket gave you such a sense
of power. And then the princely salary, a hundred
pounds a week, and next year it was going to be doubled.
She really didn’t know how she would be able to
spend it.</p>

<p>Why spend it at all? Why not invest it at four and
a half per cent.?</p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;for a rainy day!</p>

<p>Such an idea was evidently quite new to Cinderella,
and she proclaimed it as the very zenith of human wisdom.</p>

<p>“You must let me spend a little, though.”</p>

<p>She spoke as though he had charge already of her
hundred pounds a week.</p>

<p>“Not more than a fiver now and again. No need,
really. Of course when you take a holiday abroad you
can dip a bit if you want.”</p>

<p>Granny thought the provinces were vulgar, but Cinderella
was quite sure that Mr. Shelmerdine didn’t agree
with Grandmamma.</p>

<p>“Now look me right in the eye, and tell me whether
the provinces are vulgar. Honest Injun now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The good gray eyes were open to a width that was
positively astonishing. “Look right in, and consider
yourself upon your oath.”</p>

<p>Mr. Shelmerdine did not agree with Grandmamma&mdash;being
upon his oath.</p>

<p>“No, of course. The provinces are hearty and easy
to get on with, and we are very fond of each other, and
I don’t consider either of us vulgar. It is Granny’s
Victorianism, to which I always pretend to give in&mdash;although
I don’t, of course. Do you know dear, dirty
old Sheffield? The next time you go and play against
the Wednesday&mdash;I beg your pardon, I had forgotten
those wretched Tories had made your father a peer&mdash;well,
the next time you go to Sheffield&mdash;which you
never will again&mdash;ask the dear old Tykes whether they
have ever seen Mary Caspar as Alice in <i>Dick Whittington</i>.
Why, it was I who presented the Cup and Medals
to the United when they won the Hallamshire and
West Riding Charity Vase.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t say, ‘Oh, really.’ You must say,
‘Did you, ma lass! I wish I’d been playin’ in ta
match.’”</p>

<p>Would Miss Caspar have a cigarette?</p>

<p>With pleasure; but she insisted on lighting his before
he was allowed to light hers.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I know you nearly well enough to call
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>you Philip?” she said at about the fourth puff. “Your
name is such a long one, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was bound to admit that his
name was long, and that even Philip was shorter when
it became Phil.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Phil be just a little familiar, considering
that we have only known each other a week?”</p>

<p>“I seem to have known you for years and years and
years.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you really <i>mean</i> that, Philip, I don’t think
there is any reason why it shouldn’t be Phil. But you
mustn’t go beyond Mary, you know. There is only one
other person outside the family who calls me Polly,
because somehow I object to Polly on principle. And
you’ll never be able to guess who that is.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vandeleur?”</p>

<p>“Dear no&mdash;of all people. I am a perfectly ferocious
Rag.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it isn’t&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“&mdash;Be careful, Philip. <i>Very</i> dangerous ground.
But, no, it isn’t he. The only other person who is allowed
to call me Polly is the Lessee and Manager of the
Royal Italian Opera House, Blackhampton.”</p>

<p>A sudden pang of consternation went through the
heart of Mr. Philip. There was a confounded ring on
her finger!</p>

<p>“Goose,” said Mary, amused not a little by the course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>of the young man’s gaze. “Old enough to be my
father. But he’s a dear; and if I ever marry anyone&mdash;which
I never shall, of course&mdash;I don’t think I should
mind marrying him, although he’s just celebrated his
silver wedding, and he’s got a family of eleven, seven
girls and four boys, all with a broad enough accent to
derail any tram in Blackhampton.”</p>

<p>Yes; Mr. Philip enjoyed every moment of this little
luncheon at Dieudonné’s.</p>

<p>Before going to misspend his afternoon at one of
his clubs, he accompanied the charmer as far as Bedford
Gardens. They went on foot for the sake of the
exercise, which she vowed she would rather die than do
without; along the Strand if he didn’t mind, because she
loved it so.</p>

<p>The Strand was a wonderful place, they both agreed.
Certainly, he had been in it before&mdash;often&mdash;though
always on the way to the play or to supper at the Savoy.
But he had to admit that this was the first time he had
come to it in broad daylight as an amateur.</p>

<p>“You get more human nature to the square inch in
the dear old Strand than any place in the world,” said
this young woman who had traveled the five continents
in the exercise of her calling.</p>

<p>“Piper, miss. ’Orrible murder in the Borough.”</p>

<p>Mary was proof against this lure, and with true
feminine irrelevance proceeded to pile insult upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>head of injury by calling upon a young gentleman of
nine, who apparently was not going to Eton next term,
and whose person was held together by a single button,
to explain the absence of his shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>“Aren’t got none, lidy.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t ’ad none, lidy, since mother was put away for
doin’ in father a year lawst Boxin’ night.”</p>

<p>“I daresay it is quite a good reason,” said Mary
Caspar, “if only it could be translated into English.
What did your mother do to your father?”</p>

<p>“’E come ’ome ravin’, and mother throwed a paraffin
lamp at him, and the judge give her ten years.”</p>

<p>Mary Caspar opened her purse and produced the
hundredth part of her week’s salary.</p>

<p>“Never let me see you again without your boots&mdash;or
your stockings, either.”</p>

<p>The recipient looked at the sovereign doubtfully.
Then he looked up at the donor.</p>

<p>“Lidy,” he said, depositing this incredible wealth in
some inaccessible purlieus of his late father’s waistcoat,
“you’re a toff.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was rather silent as they
turned up Bedford Street. He was, of course, a drone
in the hive, but he sometimes indulged in the pernicious
habit of turning things over in his mind.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong, you know, somewhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>A kid not a day more than nine, all on his own. I think
we ought to have got his name and address.”</p>

<p>Mary thought he would have forgotten his name, and
that he wouldn’t have been at the trouble to possess
himself of anything so superfluous as an address, but
she agreed with a further display of true feminine irrelevance&mdash;and
what would any Principal Girl be without
it?&mdash;that they certainly ought to have got them.</p>

<p>And so they turned back for the purpose. But the
bird had flown. They walked as far as Trafalgar
Square, crossed over, and came back on the other side,
but their quarry had quitted the Strand.</p>

<p>“We must look out for him again,” said the heir to
the barony. “Although I expect there are thousands
like him.”</p>

<p>“Millions,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“And, of course, it don’t matter what you do in individual
cases, so the Johnnies say who know all about
it&mdash;but you must let me stand that sovereign, although
it is sweet of you and all that.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony produced the sum of one
pound sterling, and inserted it in Mary’s muff, a very
ordinary sort of rabbit-skin affair.</p>

<p>Mary declined point-blank to accept the sovereign,
which irresponsible behavior on her part made her escort
look rather troubled and unhappy.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony seemed perfectly clear in his
own mind that she ought to do as she was told, but not
being gifted in the matter of clothing his thoughts with
language, the reasons he gave seemed both vague and
inadequate to an independent-minded young woman
whose salary, for the time being, was equal to that of
the First Lord of the Treasury.</p>

<p>They parted on Grandmamma’s doorstep, with a
hearty hand-shake, and a reluctant promise on Mary’s
part to come out to tea on the morrow. The young
man walked on air to one of his numerous houses of call,
firm in the conviction that he had never enjoyed a
luncheon so much in all his born days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Ye-es, Agatha, I a-gree with you,” said the first
Baron Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth at half-past seven
that evening, twisting his face in the torment of achieving
the conventional without a suspicion of the baroque
or the bizarre. “The ve-ry next shirts I order from
Hoodlam shall all turn down. Harold Box, I believe&mdash;so
why not I? Oh, confound it all&mdash;that’s the third
I’ve ruined.”</p>

<p>“Fetch another Wally, and I will tie it for you,” said
the Suffolk Colthurst superbly.</p>

<p>It was humiliation for a Proconsul, but we are
pledged to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>but the truth in this ingenuous narrative. And of their
courtesy we ask none of our readers to accuse us of
malice.</p>

<p>“You must bend a bit, Wally.” The Suffolk Colthurst
grappled firmly with the situation. “Better order
two dozen at once from Heale and Binman. Theirs
carry more starch.”</p>

<p>Here it was that Destiny came into the picture, casual-like.</p>

<p>“Wally.” The Suffolk Colthurst had just achieved
a reticent self-respecting single bow. “Now that Lord
Warlock has agreed to that settlement, if I were you I
would send round a note to the Albany for Philip to
come and see us in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Well tied, Agatha. I’ll write a note to Philip,
now.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the truth must be set down, and that, of course, is
essential in all circumstances, the parental communication,
in spite of the fact that it had an impressive device
on the back and a motto in a dead language, was not
the first note that was opened at B4 the Albany on the
following morning. It was not the second or the third
either, because there was quite a pile of correspondence
in front of the kidneys and bacon at a quarter-past ten
in the forenoon of Tuesday, the first of February.</p>

<p>“Dear Philip,” said the parental communication
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>when it was open at last, “your Mother will be pleased
if you will come to luncheon to-morrow, as there is an
important matter she would like me to speak to you
about. Luncheon at one-thirty sharp, as I have to
go down to the House. Your affectionate Father, S. of
P.”</p>

<p>Mr. Philip helped himself pensively, but not illiberally,
to kidneys and bacon. He sprinkled salt and pepper
over them, spread mustard on the plate, buttered
his toast, poured out a cup of tea of almost immoral
strength, read over the parental communication again,
and then made use of an objurgation.</p>

<p>“I wish the good old Mater wouldn’t get so meddlin’,”
said he.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, like a dutiful young man, he decided he
must go and lunch at No. 88 Grosvenor Square. But
by the time he had put on his boots with five buttons,
had been inserted into the coat with the astrachan collar,
and had sauntered forth to his favorite florist’s,
twirling his whanghee cane, somehow the good old sky
of London didn’t look quite so bright as it did yesterday.</p>

<p>His favorite florist’s was in the charge of his favorite
young lady assistant, Miss Pearson by name, whom
a fortnight ago he had serious thoughts of calling Sally
without her permission. But a good deal of water
had flowed under London Bridge in the meantime, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>that now whether she gave her permission, or whether
she withheld it, he no longer yearned to be guilty of
any such freedom.</p>

<p>Still, Miss Pearson was a very good sort for all that,
and the heir to the barony raised his hat to her this
morning in his politest manner, although perhaps it is
right to remark that he would have done so on any other
morning, and even if Miss Pearson had not been such a
very good sort&mdash;but in that case he might have gone
a little higher up the street, as far as Miss Jackson.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Miss Pearson. How are we?”</p>

<p>Miss Pearson was so-so. Had been to the Coliseum
to see <i>Richard III</i> the previous evening.</p>

<p>“Have you been to Drury yet, Miss Pearson?”</p>

<p>No, but Miss Pearson’s best boy had promised to
take her next Monday&mdash;Monday being her night out.</p>

<p>“I <i>envy</i> you, Miss Pearson,” said the heir to the
barony with emotion. “And the young chap&mdash;of
course.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine,” said Miss Pearson, “do you
know what my impression is?”</p>

<p>Mr. Shelmerdine had not the faintest notion what
Miss Pearson’s impression was.</p>

<p>“My impression, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said Miss Pearson,
“is that you are in love.”</p>

<p>No rebutting evidence being put in, Miss Pearson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>grew grave and serious as became a young lady of good
Scottish lineage on the spindle side.</p>

<p>“If you’ll take my advice, Mr. Shelmerdine, you’ll
go a short sea voyage. I’ve noticed a deterioration in
you during the last fortnight. It is far worse than
when Cassie Smallpiece was at the Gaiety. I shall go
and see for myself on Monday, but I’ve no opinion of
actresses as a class. It is time you married that Lady
Adela, you know.”</p>

<p>It was the first time that Miss Pearson had been
moved to these communications as far as this particular
client was concerned; but the fair president of the
smartest florist in Piccadilly was a lady of considerable
social insight.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Pearson,” said the heir to the barony,
slowly and thoughtfully, “you know that I always
value your opinion, but Mary Caspar is an absolute
nailer.”</p>

<p>“Go across to Dean and Dawson’s,” said Miss Pearson.
“Or you can use my telephone if you don’t want
to run the risk of crossing the street. Egypt or Switzerland,
or a short sea voyage. Think what a blow it
would be to your father if you didn’t marry a lady in
society.”</p>

<p>“Ha, you haven’t seen her yet, Miss Pearson,” cried
the incredible young man. “If I could book a couple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>of stalls for Monday, do you think your young chap
would mind accepting ’em?”</p>

<p>“Only too pleased, I’m sure,” said Miss Pearson
promptly. “No false delicacy about Alf. He’s in the
greengrocery the other side the Marble Arch.”</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was a little “slow in the uptake,”
but, like others who labor under that natural defect,
in the end he generally contrived to get to his
destination.</p>

<p>“I hope you ain’t throwin’ yourself away, Miss
Pearson,” said the heir to the barony. “Blow to your
people, I’m sure, if you are side-tracked by anything
under a bank clerk.”</p>

<p>“Money before position, Mr. Shelmerdine, is my
motto,” said Miss Pearson. “If you’ve got the one,
you can always get the other.”</p>

<p>The heir of the barony seemed rather impressed by
this pearl of wisdom. He pondered it while that very
able and personable young woman twined a piece of
wire round a posy of violets. And then, as if to prove
a general proposition, Position itself appeared, and
somewhat abruptly terminated this instructive <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>Position entered in the person of a youthful marquis,
leading a bull terrier whose natural beauty was almost
as chastened as his own.</p>

<p>“Why, Shel&mdash;haven’t seen you for years!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Position held out a hand, gloved somewhat aggressively
in yellow. His senior by four years shook the
gauntlet warily.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Sally.”</p>

<p>Position turned its back and put its elbows on the
counter. It might have been the sole proprietor, not
only of those most desirable lock-up basement premises,
but of Miss Pearson and all its other contents. Still,
no reproof was forthcoming.</p>

<p>During an even earlier phase of Position’s adolescence,
it had been Mr. Shelmerdine’s privilege as a member
of the Eleven, a member of Pop, and of other high
dignities, to lay into Position in no uncertain manner.
Alas that his zeal had proved so unfruitful!</p>

<p><i>Autres temps, autres mœurs.</i> Had we the pen of the
sage, the fervor of the poet, the <i>sæva indignatio</i> of the
preacher, what a theme is here, my lords and gentlemen!
Position not only usurping the badge of intimacy,
reserved for the peers of the Keeper of the
Field, but actually venturing to take <i>pas</i> of him, addressing
Miss Pearson by her first name, setting his
elbows on the counter, and removing a bunch of violets
from her ample bosom, while he&mdash;the unspeakable humiliation
of it&mdash;actually had to wait meekly for his
own.</p>

<p>Had there been a toasting fork within the precincts
of those desirable lock-up basement premises, it is appalling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
to think of the consequences that might have
ensued.</p>

<p>Miss Pearson handed Mr. Shelmerdine his bunch of
violets in a manner sufficiently <i>dégagé</i>, as though her
interest in him had assumed a less acute phase. Raging
within, the heir to the barony, a mere 1905 creation,
sought the purer air of the Ritz Arcade, leaving the
field to 1720, who could be heard saluting Sally not too
chastely, as his early benefactor hurriedly crossed the
threshold of his favorite florist’s, and came into somewhat
forcible collision with an elderly, but ample lady
from Missouri, who was on a visit to Europe, and who
had come to stay at the Ritz Hotel.</p>

<p>The elderly ample lady from Missouri was fluent in
her diction; the heir to the barony was abject in his
apologies; but eventually the incident was closed by
the unlucky young man escorting the American citizeness
to her palatial temporary residence, and giving
her into the care of the hall porter.</p>

<p>Evidently, it was not going to be his day. But let
justice be done to the Fates, even when they are behaving
just about as badly as they know how. Had it not
been that the heir to the barony lingered a moment to
exchange a few brief but urbane civilities with the hall
porter of the Ritz, he must inevitably have walked into
Adela and her Pa who were passing very slowly and impressively
by the portals of this coign of the plutocracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>It was a hair’s-breadth escape. The young man had
only just time to realize his danger, bolt across the
road, almost under the very wheels of an oncoming
Barnes and Hammersmith omnibus, escape a threefold
death by violence at the instance of the passing motor,
board a taxi, and in a voice tense with emotion beseech
to be driven to Romano’s.</p>

<p>A gin and vermouth might be said to have saved this
full but chequered life.</p>

<p>“Called me Shel&mdash;my God! If only I’d got that
long-handled, old-fashioned one with the five prongs&mdash;!”</p>

<span class="smaller">AFFAIRS OF STATE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Still</span> feeling rather a puppet in the hands of Fate,
Mr. Philip reached No. 88 Grosvenor Square, the corner
house, about twenty minutes after the hour appointed.
But as the great Proconsul really must be
at the House of Lords by a quarter to four, luncheon
had already begun.</p>

<p>“I notice, Philip,” said S. of P., who had arranged
with the Woolsack to address his fellow peers in support
of the Daylight Saving Bill that afternoon, “that you
hardly realize the importance of the part played by
time in the lives of us all. I said half-past one distinctly
in my note.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate young man apologized very humbly
and politely to the great Proconsul.</p>

<p>Considering what an Odyssey his life had been that
morning, the young fellow made a very decent luncheon.
Just the wing of a woodcock, and a bit off the breast,
a few slices of York ham, a jam puff or so, a bite of
cheese and an imperial pint of bitter ale out of a presentation
silver tankard bearing the arms of Ch: Ch.
Blind instinct seemed to tell the young man that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>must keep up his strength, since there was a dull sensation
behind the chocolate waistcoat, knitted for him by
his mother, which clearly suggested that trouble was
looming in the middle distance. Port wine, Green
Chartreuse, a big cigar, and black coffee all played their
manly parts. Yes, with the help of the gods he might
be able to keep up his end all right; although he was
by no means sure that he liked that concentrated,
governing-classes look in the eye of the good old
Mater.</p>

<p>The after-luncheon conference in the library was
most impressive. The Governing Classes were distinctly
fortissimo; and in spite of his ample sustenance,
Mr. Philip felt rather meager in the presence of this
deep reverence for the established order, and so much
of that which is best in the public and private life of
these islands.</p>

<p>Lord Warlock, subject to certain contingencies, was
prepared to accept other contingencies in respect of
Adela. The First Baron was admirably clear and statesmanlike
in his <i>aperçu</i> of the most interesting position
which had been evolved by the higher diplomacy.</p>

<p>“Sometime in October, at dear Saint George’s,”
thought the good old Mater.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was silent, dismal, and undone.
He had hesitated about a second Green Chartreuse;
he wished now that he had obeyed his inward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>monitor. There was a sense of vacuum behind the
knitted chocolate waistcoat that was really the devil.</p>

<p>“It is like this, you know&mdash;” The young man
floundered and came down rather awkwardly at fence
Number One. “Adela and I&mdash;well, fact is, we
haven’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Governing Classes showed great patience.</p>

<p>“We haven’t sort of&mdash;you know&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we don’t, my boy,” said S. of P. with
the blandness that goes so well with conscious power.</p>

<p>“The end of October is such a <i>good</i> time,” said
Mother, “especially if there is to be an autumn session.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the young man, “but, fact is, Adela
and I have never quite hit it off from the start.”</p>

<p>The Governing Classes, with lowered eyelids, looked
at one another across the chaste expanse of Messrs.
Maple’s hearthrug. The pause was rather trying.
Yes, an awful pity about that second Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>At last S. of P. was sorry.</p>

<p>This may look a little inadequate on the part of S.
of P. But it wasn’t really. Eton and Balliol, “distinguished
public service,” terms of intimacy with His
Majesty’s late Government are not incapable of resonance
on the domestic hearth. It was already clear
that the higher statesmanship might have to be tempered
with a little benevolent autocracy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>
<p>“Warlock is really most liberal&mdash;that is, of course,
for an Irish peerage.”</p>

<p>“<i>Most</i> liberal, Wally,” the Suffolk Colthurst chimed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t October rather soon, Mater?” said Mr. Philip,
beginning to shape like a tailor, at fence Number Two.</p>

<p>“The sooner, the better, we think.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Agatha.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but&mdash;” said the unfortunate heir.</p>

<p>The Governing Classes were to be butted no <i>buts</i>,
however.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said the good old Mater, “your father has
been at the trouble to draw up an announcement for the
<i>Morning Post</i>. It will be shown to Lord Warlock this
evening, and with his sanction it will be sent to the
editor by the first post to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should trouble, Mater, if I were
you,” said the unhappy young man.</p>

<p>Now, that really was rather ineffectual, and sounded
quite as much so as it appears.</p>

<p>“I think the announcement should be made at once,”
said Father. “Adela is a charming girl; you are a
very lucky fellow; and you are to be envied. Philip,
my dear boy, I congratulate you with all my heart.”</p>

<p>S. of P. shook the heir to the barony warmly by the
hand.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, dear Philip.” And Mother offered the
blonde, bland frontispiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>No seaworthy excuse can be put forward for dear
Philip’s refusal to kiss his mother. Not a refusal exactly;
but he burked the issue by asking to be allowed
to read the announcement which had been drawn up for
the <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>A very little research discovered the interesting document
on Father’s writing-table.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip read the announcement as duly set forth
in the elegant maternal hand. He then sighed heavily;
and then it was the Green Chartreuse at last began to
play up to its reputation.</p>

<p>The young man folded up the announcement carefully,
and placed it in his cigar case.</p>

<p>“Well, if you prefer to send it yourself&mdash;so long
as it <i>is</i> sent, my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t forget all about it, Philip,” said
the maternal one.</p>

<p>“But I am not going to send it,” said the young man,
all sweetness and simplicity.</p>

<p>Yes, pretty good work by the Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>Mother got the first gun into action.</p>

<p>Why wasn’t dear Philip going to send it?</p>

<p>Dear Philip thought it was premature.</p>

<p>Mournful interlude on the tragic note. Warlock
would not take kindly to delay, said Father in deep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>tones. Was it kind to dear Adela? asked the third person
at the conference.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear the grounds of your objection,”
said S. of P.</p>

<p>It was merely that they didn’t seem quite to hit it off.
Adela was an awfully nice girl; the fault was his entirely;
but still he didn’t quite feel as if&mdash;</p>

<p>In this charming passage in the aria the Suffolk
Colthurst fluted tremulously. So <i>sweet</i> a girl as Adela,
so <i>good</i> a family, such <i>excellent</i> connections&mdash;</p>

<p>The great Proconsul was rather grieved, in his deepest
and richest baritone.</p>

<p>But there it was! said the Green Chartreuse, doing its
level best for England, Home and Beauty.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Governing Classes seemed hardly
able to concede that it was there. They were dining
that evening in Mount Street to meet Warlock’s sister,
Dumbarton’s sixth duchess. Hadn’t dear Philip better
return the sheet of note paper to his father?</p>

<p>The young man rose slowly to confront the Governing
Classes.</p>

<p>“Fact is, you know,” said he, “I haven’t asked her
yet; and if I did ask her I’m pretty certain she wouldn’t
have me. Not that I blame her, of course.”</p>

<p>“Philip, you must listen to me,” said the Proconsul.
“Lady Adela will, as I have reason to know, be quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>willing to identify herself with the wishes of her family.
My dear boy, allow me to express the hope that you, as
the future head of yours, will show yourself equally
amenable.”</p>

<p>The firmness of the Powers was stupendous. But
firmness comes easy when you have passed your life
thinking imperially.</p>

<p>Wasn’t it all rather selfish of Philip?</p>

<p>Has a man a right to be selfish, even when he’s staking
his life’s happiness? Depends on the sort of man
you are, said the Green Chartreuse. Personally, we
consider, said the Green Chartreuse, you will be the
“absolute it” in the fool class if you allow your people
to queer your pitch for you on the score of Family.
Adela is a cat, and you know it; Mary Caspar is a girl
in a million, and you know that, too; you have no need
to be ambitious; you will have quite as much money,
and quite as much position as is good for any young
fellow. If you don’t want to make a clean sweep of
all the prizes in the Juggins Department you will answer
in the negative in a quiet, firm, and manly voice.</p>

<p>Here it was, moreover, that Destiny, who seemed to
hold a watching brief for the defendant, played a very
useful card for the Green Chartreuse. S. of P. consulted
his watch, and raised his well-brushed white eyebrows
in dismay. A quarter past three already; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>he made a point of never missing prayers if he had to
keep an appointment with the Woolsack.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, there was only one thing to be
done; it was to move that the Conference stand adjourned.</p>

<p>“Come to luncheon on Sunday, Philip, and in the
meantime there is no need to send the announcement to
the papers.”</p>

<p>We hope you concur, my lords and gentlemen, that it
was a decidedly useful card that the old fox, Destiny,
had played for the Green Chartreuse.</p>

<span class="smaller">LICENTIOUS BEHAVIOR OF THE GREEN<br />
CHARTREUSE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heir to the barony was a dull young man&mdash;it
is idle to pretend that he wasn’t&mdash;yet in his slow-witted
way he had a habit of turning things over in his mind.
If he married Adela it would give pleasure to his excellent
parents; it would advance him in the eyes of the
world; people would say here is a young man with more
in him than we thought&mdash;see how well he has married.
But there was no shirking the fact that if he married
Adela he was bound to be miserable for the rest of his
days.</p>

<p>Weak, disgraceful thoughts, Shelmerdine, quoth the
Twin Brethren, Eton and Christ Church. It was not
on <i>our</i> playing fields you learned to be so puerile. No
girl in London makes a more distinguished appearance
in black velvet. You will shoot at High Cliff. With
what grace and charm will the seventh <i>married</i> daughter
preside over that dear little house in Grosvenor
Street, on the left, going to the park, which your admirable
parents have promised her admirable parent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>take for you on a lease, in order that you may both be
near them. Shelmerdine, we don’t know when we have
been so ashamed of an alumnus of ours. If you haven’t
enough character, sir, to tackle the very ordinary job
of driving a young woman on the curb&mdash;as every
young woman ought to be driven for her soul’s welfare
at the beginning&mdash;you are a miserable shirker, sir,
and unworthy of your liberal nurture.</p>

<p>Sir, in that event, we wash our hands of you; and
you are free to form an alliance with this underbred
Bohemian&mdash;it is not our custom to mince our language
when our emotions are deeply stirred! You will bring
down the gray hairs of your admirable parents in sorrow
to the grave; your portrait will receive the freedom
of the gutter press; you will never be asked to shoot
at High Cliff; you will bring tragedy into your own
life and into the life of others&mdash;in fact, sir, and in a
word&mdash;one understood these infernal safety-razors
were guaranteed not to cut gashes into one’s neck!</p>

<p>Little recked Cinderella of the reason why the heir
to the barony had to appear at tea-time on Friday done
up in court plaster. He was also strangely pensive and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>She was as gay and as charming as usual; and she
had just been engaged to create the title rôle in Mr.
Wingrove’s brilliant new play at the Millennium, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>was to be produced in the middle of Lent. But poor
Philip was far from being himself. Still, he insisted on
walking home with her to Bedford Gardens.</p>

<p>However, by the time they had reached the Strand,
that romantic thoroughfare, the murder was pretty well
out. It really came out at the moment they stood on
the edge of the kerb opposite Charing Cross, waiting
to commit their frail lives to the maëlstrom of mechanically
propelled vehicles.</p>

<p>“Fact is, old girl,”&mdash;the heir to the barony gripped
Mary firmly by the arm to see that she didn’t step off
the kerb too soon&mdash;“fact is, old girl, I want a pal.
Will you be a pal to me?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I will, Philip,” said Mary, as they
walked arm in arm into the jaws of a Barnes and Hammersmith
’bus.</p>

<p>“A pal for life, I mean, old girl.”</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the opposite kerb, Mary
was quivering. And the color in her face surmounted
the natural pallor of her profession.</p>

<p>“Oh!&mdash;but, Philip&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You <i>will</i>, old girl!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that Granny&mdash;besides&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Besides what, old girl?” The knitted chocolate
waistcoat was being grievously assaulted.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do&mdash;for you, I mean&mdash;although it is
sweet of you to have asked me, Philip.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“It’s whether it would do for you, old girl. I’m not
much of a chap, I know, but I should begin to pick up
a bit&mdash;I’m sure I should&mdash;if I had got a real pal like
you to pull my socks up for me.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t because I don’t like you, Philip,” said
Mary, so nicely that the owner of the knitted chocolate
waistcoat wanted to clasp her to it in one of
London’s most important thoroughfares. “It is because
I do.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you risk it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think I ought&mdash;really. Your people,
you know. And I’m sure that Granny&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is our affair. I’ve thought it all out;
and if a chap wants a wife, I don’t see that anybody
has a right to meddle. It’s askin’ a lot, I know&mdash;your
career and all that&mdash;but I’ve enough for two,
and you wouldn’t have to sing and dance to three thousand
people when you were feeling so cheap you didn’t
know how.”</p>

<p>Mary was troubled by this importunity as a girl as
nice as she was bound to be. She had already grown to
like this rather heavy young man. She felt capable of
being a father, a mother, a brother and a sister to him,
or any equally near relation whose function it would be
to pull his socks up for him. But she was also a very
sensible and unselfish girl, moreover, a pretty clear-sighted
one; and when she said that Granny would never,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>she really meant what she said, and a great deal more
than she did say.</p>

<p>All the same, she was very proud and happy as she
turned up Bedford Street, with the hand of Philip still
gripping her arm very tightly, although in this haven
there was not a solitary Barnes and Hammersmith
’bus to warrant a continuance of such a course of behaviour.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony, in our humble judgment, was
about the luckiest young fellow in London just then to
be walking up Bedford Street with a girl as good as
gold in his possession. Very nearly, but not quite in
his possession. He had come at his fence so boldly; it
was an inspiration to have taken off just where he did
in the welter of Barnes and Hammersmith omnibuses
in front of Charing Cross; his solid, manly British
qualities had shone out suddenly so clear and free, that
where another might have hesitated and come a purler,
this sportsman had gone straight at the obstacle and
very nearly come home a winner. Very nearly captured
the queen of beauty, but not quite, although she
was feeling very proud and happy because of the honor
done to her&mdash;and it <i>is</i> an honor, O you young ladies
of Newnham and Girton, the highest that can be paid to
you, so please to remember, my dears, when you turn
down your thumbs to the next undesirable&mdash;and she
blushed so charmingly all the way up the street that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>it was a pity there were not more lamps in Long Acre
by which you could have seen her.</p>

<p>Their feet swayed together in a delightful rhythm,
in their radiant progress: spats by Grant and Cockburn,
and Mr. Moykopf’s most superior hand-stitched
russia leather, and eight and eleven penny Walk-easies
made by the gross at Kettering, which had no spats
upon ’em. Yes, it was a lovely walk in the dark amid
the purlieus of Long Acre. Several times they lost
their way, and didn’t try very hard to find it. And
then, suddenly, from out the distant mirk, where the
time-spirit was keeping its grim eye upon ’em, the hour
was tolled from Saint Martin’s Church.</p>

<p>One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven!&mdash;the
excited heart of the Principal Girl counted each
stroke. Cinderella must fly. She would only just have
time to drink her Oxo, and to get into her rags&mdash;which
were not rags at all really&mdash;and fix her war
paint, if the great British public was not to receive one
of the severest disappointments in its annals.</p>

<p>“Well, think about it, old girl&mdash;although I don’t
mean to take ‘No.’ I’ve made up my mind to that.”</p>

<p>They were on Granny’s doorstep now. And there
let us leave them without waiting to see what happened.</p>

<p><i>Did</i> something happen?</p>

<p>There is no need to gratify idle curiosity upon the
subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>
<p>The really important thing that did happen, before
Cinderella slipped her latch-key in the door, was that
Mr. Philip re-affirmed his manly determination not to
take “No” for an answer. He vowed, moreover, that
he would come and interview Grandmamma after she
had had her siesta on the afternoon of the Sabbath Day.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROCONSULAR TOUCH</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been a crowded and glorious week for the
Green Chartreuse, but it was not until the Sabbath Day
that it had really to embrace the crisis of its fate. Mary
had not said “Yes,” and she had not said “No,” but
she had seemed to imply that Grandmamma might prove
obdurate. Then there was also that little obstacle in
Grosvenor Square to negotiate. Yes, taking one fact
with another, it was reasonably clear to the Twin Brethren
that Sunday promised to be a rather important day
in the calendar.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony did not go to church on the
morning of the fateful day, although, perhaps, it would
have been wise to have done so. He read <i>The Referee</i>
instead, in order to collect a few ideas as to his general
bearing in the convention after lunch in the library at
No. 88.</p>

<p>The Governing Classes were decidedly FF. Not a
day later than the third week in October, Warlock
thought, otherwise it would play the dickens with his
shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Egypt would be such a <i>nice</i> place in which to spend
the honeymoon,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Little recked the Powers, however, of the Homeric
struggle that was being waged within the precincts of
the immaculate braided morning coat that sat so perfectly
upon the manly form of Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>Do if you Dare, said the Twin Brethren.</p>

<p>Don’t be a Cur, said the Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>And as no young man likes to be thought a Cur by a
boon companion, the miserable yet half-exultant Philip
gathered his forces for the conflict.</p>

<p>“There’s something, Father, I’d like to say,” said
he, as he performed the superfluous action of tucking
the end of his handkerchief still further up his shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p>Perfect frankness was invited.</p>

<p>“I would like to say,” said the young man, “that I
don’t feel that I can marry Adela.”</p>

<p>The timepiece with the silver tones had the only
speaking part for the space of ninety seconds. And
then out spoke Mother.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>“Can’t&mdash;possibly&mdash;Mater.”</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>And all this time the benevolent autocrat, who had put
on his eyeglasses and taken them off again, and then
put them on again, was trying to recapture the touch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>of a great Proconsul who had started out in life with
a Balliol scholarship.</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear boy, <i>you</i> must decide.” The
Proconsular eyelids conveyed delicately to the Suffolk
Colthurst that, after all, the <i>Suaviter in Modo</i> cannot be
surpassed in the hands of an acknowledged master.
“But, as Warlock knows already, we shall be very happy
to make Lady Adela welcome in the family.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course, but you see&mdash;”</p>

<p>Neither parent appeared to see, unfortunately. The
poor Green Chartreuse grew desperate.</p>

<p>“So you see, I’ve kind of proposed to another girl.”</p>

<p>The Proconsul took off his eyeglasses and buttoned
his coat; the Colthurst of Suffolk manipulated her third
and fourth chins into a condition of majestically eloquent
inarticulation. The silver timepiece alone was
moved to make an observation, and that, of course, was
quite irrelevant.</p>

<p>“Her name is Mary Caspar, and she is an absolute
nailer,” said the heir to the barony.</p>

<p>“An actress, I believe,” said Mother, who, like every
member of her family, had an almost uncanny memory
for names.</p>

<p>“An absolute nailer,” said Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago the young man had taken to Jaeger
underclothing, but even that hardly seemed able to cope
with the thermometer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t exactly definite. She seems to think there
are things against it, but I’m going to talk it over this
afternoon with her old grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Who, pray, is her grandmother?”</p>

<p>“Her name is Mrs. Cathcart, and she lives at 10
Bedford Gardens.”</p>

<p>“I will call upon her,” said Mother, somewhat ostentatiously,
making a note of the address.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said the great Proconsul, “you must listen
to me. I am afraid this is all very irregular. A man
of your age, my dear boy, ought to know that in these
days they give swingeing damages for breach. This
must go no further, you understand; and the best thing
we can hope for is, that the young woman’s grandmother
is as sensible as we have a right to expect an old
woman and a grandmother to be.”</p>

<p>“But I am goin’ to marry Mary if she’ll have me,
father,” said Mr. Philip, all politeness and simplicity.</p>

<p><i>Fortiter in Re</i>, as classical scholars do not require to
be told, is the natural corollary of <i>Suaviter in Modo</i>.
Spasmodic trumpetings were emitted freely by the
great Proconsul. The Colthurst of Suffolk also had
recourse to the clarion note. It was really a scene of
great majesty and power, and it lasted until hard upon
tea-time. The behavior of the heir was subversive of
all there was left to subvert in the Cosmos, since the
wicked Welsh Chancellor’s deadly missiles had knocked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>Mars and Jupiter and several other leading planets clean
out of their orbits.</p>

<p>What would People say? said Mother.</p>

<p>Swingeing damages these days and rightly, re-affirmed
the great Proconsul.</p>

<p>“She wasn’t that sort of girl at all,” said Philip the
manful. He had had to make all the running. Father
and Mother mustn’t misjudge her. And they must forgive
him if he seemed to have lost his head a bit, but it
was all for the best, he was sure. Never been able to
hit it off with Adela; hadn’t any tastes in common. It
would be better so.</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd, Philip,” said Mother, upon G
sharp.</p>

<p>Was it conceivable that the eldest son was without
a sense of moral responsibility? blandly inquired the ex-Resident
of Barataria North-West.</p>

<p>“I hope the grandmother of the person is a woman
of the world,” said Mother. “I will call upon her without
delay.”</p>

<p>And then the heir to the barony spoke like a very
nice young chap. He sincerely hoped his excellent parents
would not blame him more than they felt obliged.
He had thought it all out in the watches of the night;
it would be all for the best, she was such an absolute
dear. He would be awfully pleased to trot her round
for inspection; and was there really any reason why a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>man rising thirty, with a private income, should not
marry the nicest girl in London?</p>

<p>“But, then,” said Mother, “dearest Adela is a girl
in a thousand.”</p>

<p>“And please don’t forget,” said Father the Proconsul,
“you are my successor.”</p>

<p>If only he could Abdicate! murmured the wretched
Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>Neither Father nor Mother heard it, fortunately.</p>

<p>And then in tones of solemn music, the silver-tongued
timepiece chimed the hour of half-past four.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” said the heir to the barony, with a sigh
of relief. “How awfully late!” And rising to his
full height from Messrs. Maple’s choice upholstery, he
dispensed a cloud of sweet and gentle and perfectly
sincere apology.</p>

<p>He did not desire to bring a moment of pain to his
excellent parents. He was sure it would be all for the
best if only he could persuade her to have him&mdash;he
had not persuaded her yet, worse luck! But, in spite
of this charming urbanity, Mother took no leave of
him; and Father had “a damned disinheriting countenance,”
as he escaped through the door of the library.</p>

<p>A pretty mess you have made of things, you fool,
snarled the Twin Brethren, as Joseph showed him over
the door-mat and whistled up a taxi.</p>

<span class="smaller">JANE’S AFTERNOON OUT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Green Chartreuse was able to break its journey
at Romano’s, as it passed that home of wassail <i>en route</i>
to Bedford Gardens. And having done so, it was able to
answer back a bit, but only in a very minor key just
now, my lords and gentlemen.</p>

<p>The dear girl herself opened the door to Mr. Philip;
it was Jane’s afternoon out. Wasn’t Mary very tired
after the two performances yesterday? Not a bit.
But wasn’t he a bit below the weather? No? She
thought he looked so, rather. Merely because he had
been lunching with his people, was it? Very wrong to
make a joke of such a filial action, particularly as Grosvenor
Square on a Sunday is thought to be the home of
the serious.</p>

<p>Granny was sitting very upright in the cozy corner,
and looking very stately in her smartest cap with lace
on it, that had been worn by Siddons. An approximation
of the grand manner when she shook hands. The
weather was not cold, perhaps, for the season of the
year; but when one was turned four-and-eighty, one’s
vitality was perhaps a little less than formerly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>Miss Mary brought in the tea, looking frightfully
demure.</p>

<p>Grandmamma herself had a preference for Chayney
tea. She hoped Mr. Shelmerdine did not object to
Chayney tea; if he did, there was whisky and soda
which some gentlemen preferred. John Peter Kendall
always preferred it; likewise John his father; and she
had heard that this preference was shared by Edward
Bean, who was her godpapa&mdash;and the silver mug he
gave her at her christening was upon the chiffonnier.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Shelmerdine heard that the Lane was going
to double Mary’s salary, and desired her to sign a contract
for a term of five years?</p>

<p>“Two hundred a week, Mr. Shelmerdine. A fabulous
sum. Why, I don’t think that Garrick&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not a penny more than she deserves, ma’am,”
averred the heir to the barony.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, it is enough to make Edward
Bean turn in his grave. A preposterous sum for a
girl of very ordinary ability, without any true histrionic
genius. Why, I don’t think that Siddons in the
heyday of her power&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, of course she didn’t, you jealous old Granny.
And if I were a woman of genius like you are, and she
was, I shouldn’t be getting it either and signing contracts.
Don’t you agree, Philip?”</p>

<p>And Miss Mary fixed the young man with her glorious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>gray eye, and said to him quite distinctly by the Marconi
system: “Say Yes, in your heartiest voice, like a dear
boy.”</p>

<p>So of course, the young fellow had to say Yes, when
he meant No.</p>

<p>It is unkind to make comparisons, but tea and cake
in Bedford Gardens, thought Mr. Philip, is a far more
interesting function than a four-course luncheon farther
west. And yet the young man had by no means a great
appetite just now. It was the crisis of his fate. Had
Mary told Grandmamma? And what would Grandmamma
say, if told she had been? For men and gods
these were all-important questions.</p>

<p>Certainly, the old thing in the real lace that had been
worn by Siddons was very <i>grande dame</i> indeed. Diction
clear cut, lively and forcible; not a single English
actor worthy of the name in the present generation,
and she hadn’t seen the foreign ones; in fact, the race
had perished with Mr. Macready, who had taken her to
Gadshill to drink tea with Mr. Dickens.</p>

<p>“But, what about Sir Henry Irving, Granny?” said
Mary, covertly twitching her charming left eyelid at
the heir.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, for an amateur, my dear, but better
fitted to play the hind-leg of a dragon than the Prince
of Denmark.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how terribly severe!” said Mary, so demurely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>that the Morning Coat had an overpowering desire to
clasp her to its braided bosom.</p>

<p>“Good at melodrama no doubt, my dear,” said Grandmamma,
“in the Surrey theaters; but to my mind wholly
unfitted to carry on the great tradition of Edward Bean
and John Kendall.”</p>

<p>It is by no means clear that the Braided Morning
Coat was able to enjoy Grandmamma’s caustic criticism
of the present hopelessly inferior histrionic age as
much as it might have done, because there was that
sinking sensation somewhere about the third button
which somehow seemed to suggest that it was going
to be its turn presently. And although a very ordinary
sort of coat, which put forth no special claim to be endowed
with the gift of prophecy, in this it was not a
great way off the mark.</p>

<p>When at last its turn came, it seemed to arrive
rather suddenly. It was when the Chayney tea and the
cake and bread-and-butter, having ceased to have attractions,
were removed by Mary, still acting as deputy
to Jane the parlor-maid.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine,” said the Lady Macbeth to John
Peter Kendall, “I am given to understand that you
have been kind enough to make my granddaughter a proposal
of marriage?”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind, ma’am,” murmured the
Braided Morning Coat, whose diction, however, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>that of Eton and Ch: Ch:, was for the time being, at
any rate, nothing like so distinguished as that of Grandmamma.</p>

<p>“I may say at once, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said the Lady
Macbeth to John Peter Kendall, “that I am sensible
of the honor that has been paid to my granddaughter.
Further, I may say that she also is sensible of the honor
that has been paid her, as every right-minded girl
should be, even when, as in this case, she is unfortunately
unable to avail herself of it.”</p>

<p>That unhappy sense of inadequacy was coming upon
Mr. Philip which afflicted him on the occasions he called
at the Foreign Office to look up the friends of his
youth.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, you are a personable and mannerly
young man&mdash;I am old enough to speak with freedom,
and even if I were not I have always been accustomed
to use it. You have considerable private means, my
granddaughter informs me, and I think it is probable
that you will make an excellent husband for a young
woman in your own sphere of life; but, to be quite
frank with you, Mr. Shelmerdine, I do not feel that I
can give my consent to the match.”</p>

<p>The Braided Morning Coat was cast down not a
little.</p>

<p>Still, Grandmamma knew how to temper firmness of
character with kindness and consideration; and that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>of course, the world has a right to look for in majestic
old ladies who have played Lady Macbeth to John
Peter Kendall.</p>

<p>“My granddaughter, Mr. Shelmerdine, comes of a
very old theatrical stock. One of her forebears&mdash;an
ancestor of my own&mdash;played in Shakespeare’s own
company. Without impropriety, I think I am entitled
to say that her standing in her profession is likely to
be one of eminence.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat hardly needed that assurance.</p>

<p>“In the circumstances, Mr. Shelmerdine, perhaps I
am entitled to ask what your own profession is, and the
nature of your standing in it?”</p>

<p>This question was a little too complex for the Braided
Morning Coat to be able to answer offhand. Still,
the admirable garment struggled manfully, and did its
level best.</p>

<p>Four years in the Guards, but at a loose end at present.
Had thought of going into Parliament. Lady
Macbeth allowed that the ablest young men in the
country made rather a point of finding their way into
Parliament, and long might it be so; but unfortunately,
this particular able young man was not in Parliament
yet.</p>

<p>“If it will help things, ma’am,” said the Braided
Morning Coat, “I will see about it at once.”</p>

<p>It was spoken like a man of spirit and an English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>gentleman, which after all is just what you expect of
a Braided Morning Coat and Spats by Grant and Cockburn;
but Grandmamma, confessing to reluctance, was
bound to say that, although this spirited conduct might
help things a little, she was afraid it would not help them
sufficiently.</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat was awfully sorry. So was
Grandmamma, sincerely sorry. Such a mannerly and
personable young man; same school as John Peter Kendall,
though not the same college. But it appeared
to her, speaking with all reserve, and an ample sense
of responsibility, that Mr. Shelmerdine’s status in his
profession&mdash;whatever his profession might be, and she
was not so clear on that point as she would like to be&mdash;was
due to the fact that he was the eldest son of his
father.</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat confessed frankly that it
might be so, although he was not without pecuniary resources
of his own. There was also a small property
in Cheshire which had come to him recently through
his Aunt Tabitha, and was let on a five years’ lease to
one of the founders of the Zionist movement.</p>

<p>“I learn from my granddaughter, Mr. Shelmerdine,
that your father is a Peer.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat humbly made that damaging
admission.</p>

<p>“And that you succeed to the title?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat, beginning to feel very low
and miserable, pleaded guilty to this also.</p>

<p>“All this, to my mind, Mr. Shelmerdine, constitutes
an insuperable barrier.” Diction beautifully clear and
mellow. How can it be otherwise with the Bean and
Kendall tradition!</p>

<p>“Let me make myself quite understood, Mr. Shelmerdine.
It hardly seems right, to my mind, that an old
theatrical family should form an alliance with a comparatively
recent peerage. I believe, Mr. Shelmerdine,
‘comparatively recent’ is not in excess of the facts.
Jane, my parlor maid, has looked it up in <i>Debrett</i>, as
my eyesight is not of the best. Created 1904, I believe,
to the best of my recollection, during Mr. Vandeleur’s
second administration.”</p>

<p>The answer was in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Your father is a man of great distinction, I understand,
a Proconsul who has rendered invaluable service
to the Empire. All that I have heard about him redounds
to his honor, but I cannot think he would give
his sanction to this proposed alliance. I may say that
I should not, if I were he.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat was rather distressed.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Mr. Shelmerdine, I am strongly opposed
to this modern craze for contracting matrimonial
alliances between the theatrical profession and the peerage.
To my mind, they are two entirely alien institutions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
They both have their personal traditions and their
private status, of which they have a right to be jealous;
but it seems to me, and I am sure I voice the opinion
of John Peter Kendall, were he not in his grave, that
this unfortunate custom, which has lately come into
vogue, lowers the dignity of both those institutions, is
demoralizing in itself, and tends to diminish the respect
in which either is held by the Public.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat felt that “Hear, hear!”
would have been appropriate to this beautifully delivered
oration. But it had not the spirit now to say
“Hear, hear” to anything. Its fond but presumptuous
hopes lay shattered in a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>“The Public expects certain things of you, Mr. Shelmerdine,
as the future head of a distinguished family.
As a woman of extended public experience, I would like
to give you this piece of advice, which was given to
me by Mr. Macready: Never disappoint the Public,
and the Public will never disappoint you. You have
your duties to fulfil&mdash;to yourself, to your family, and
to your country. I do not say that my granddaughter
would be incapable of helping you to fulfil them, because
a member of an old theatrical family, in my judgment,
Mr. Shelmerdine, is unworthy of the great traditions
in which she has been bred if she cannot adorn
any position to which it may please Providence to call
her. But, at the same time, I recognize that public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>opinion looks to you to form an alliance elsewhere. I
am sure it will be a great disappointment to the world,
and a great grief to your excellent parents, whom I
have not the pleasure of knowing, but who, I am sure,
must be very worthy as well as very distinguished people,
if you should persist in this desire to form an alliance
with my granddaughter.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat, for all the compliments paid
to it, which it had every reason to think sincere, began
to feel as chastened as if it had been knocked down and
run over by a Barnes and Hammersmith omnibus. Long
before Grandmamma had said her say, the unlucky garment
hadn’t a kick left in it.</p>

<p>Where was Mary? Somehow it did not seem to be
playing quite fair to leave him all this time to the
tender mercies of Grandmamma. Full of mischief like
the rest of ’em, thought the Braided Morning Coat.
She knows all the time we are gettin’ it terrific; but
instead of standin’ by us like a man and a brother, she
retires to the basement to help Cook peel the potatoes
for supper.</p>

<p>“I hope, ma’am,” said the miserable varlet, “your decision
is not a final one.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Mr. Shelmerdine, that I can find no
reason at present to think otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, it’s hardly my fault that I may have
to succeed my father.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>
<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, I quite accept that statement.”</p>

<p>In the neck again, you silly blighter, snarled the
Twin Brethren.</p>

<p>“I’d abdicate if I could, but I can’t, ma’am, accordin’
to the rules of the Constitution. My Governor
says&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, I fully appreciate the insurmountable
nature of the barrier.”</p>

<p>“I shall have enough to keep a wife, ma’am, but if
you feel that I ought to go into Parliament, I shall be
only too pleased to see about it at once.”</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth appreciated the honorable nature of
the proposal, which intensified her great regret. But
even a seat in Parliament could not gloss over the fact
that he was the son of his father.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the front door bell pealed loudly down in
the basement and reverberated throughout the house.
A casual caller&mdash;perhaps Grandmamma’s old friend,
Sir Swire, who called to see her most Sundays when he
was in London.</p>

<p>The Braided Morning Coat winged a pious apostrophe
to its private, particular gods.</p>

<p>Alas! the luckless garment was a trifle premature in
its hymn of thanksgiving.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br/>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH MARY QUALIFIES FOR THE RÔLE<br />
OF THE BAD GIRL OF THE FAMILY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> who do you suppose it was, my lords and gentlemen,
who pulled that blessed bell-wire? No, not the
ex-lessee of the Cornmarket Theater. Miss Mary, helping
Cook to peel the potatoes down in the basement,
made herself acquainted with that fact when she pulled
aside the window curtains and looked up through the
area. Cockades and things were before the door of No.
10 Bedford Gardens; a raking pair of chestnuts; and
a smart rubber-tired vehicle with armorial bearings.</p>

<p>The Bad Girl of the Family, peering through the
kitchen curtains, with a half-peeled potato in one hand,
and a bone-hafted knife in the other, saw Jeames de
la Pluche, Esquire, who in that charming but absurd
fur cape reminded her not a little of Harry Merino
as the Cat in the moral drama of <i>Dick Whittington</i>,
leap down from his perch with marked agility, whisk
open the door, and lend assistance to something very
uncommon in the way of distinction.</p>

<p>Uncommon Distinction was blonde and bland of countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and <i>very</i> grande dame, as you could tell by her
Carriage. Looked through her folders, and saw Number
10 over the fanlight; and as this she did, one of
those terrible flashes of feminine intuition overtook
Mary, that this must surely be Mother.</p>

<p>Yes, Mother undoubtedly. Had not Philip himself
the same bland, blonde frontispiece; the same ample look
of nourishment; the same air of deliberation as of one
a little slow in the uptake; the same faint far-off suggestion
of a finely grown vegetable? And to the quick
eye of the feminine observer through the kitchen curtains,
there were certain things pertaining to Mother
which, up to the present, Son had not developed.</p>

<p>The clang of the front door bell reverberated through
the basement.</p>

<p>“Drat it, Miss Mary,” said Cook. “And me not
dressed yet. Would you mind letting in Sir Swire?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said Miss Mary.</p>

<p>“But hadn’t you better leave your knife and your
pertater, Miss Mary?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Swire won’t mind those, Hannah; they’ll
amuse him,” said the Bad Girl of the Family, who was
half-way up the kitchen stairs already.</p>

<p>Mother upon the doorstep, in her new ermine tippet,
was shocked not a little, deep down in the recesses of
her nature. Still of course she was far too well found in
the ways of the world to give her feelings publication.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>But if one is so ill-advised as to visit in Bohemian circles
in the afternoon of the Sabbath Day, one must be
prepared for all contingencies. Still, a half-pared potato,
a sack-cloth apron, and a bone-hafted kitchen
knife is a rather informal reception of a real peeress
from Grosvenor Square on the part of Bedford Gardens.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cathcart at home?” said Grosvenor Square,
No. 88, the corner house, very bland and splendid.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;<i>won’t</i> you come in?” said the Bad Girl
winningly.</p>

<p>Impressive entrance of Governing Classes into an
ill-lit but fairly spacious interior, which had a bust of
Edward Bean over the hatstand, and John Peter Kendall
as Richard II by&mdash;not after&mdash;Maclise over the
dining-room door.</p>

<p>“Lady Shelmerdine,” said the bland and splendid
one, as Mary pushed the front door to with her foot
because her hands were occupied.</p>

<p>“Of Potterhanworth?” said the Bad Girl in tones
warm and velvety.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the Governing Classes, pained, perhaps,
a little.</p>

<p>“Philip’s mother&mdash;so delighted&mdash;hope you don’t
object to potatoes&mdash;it’s Jane’s afternoon out.”</p>

<p>But no further communication was forthcoming from
the Governing Classes all the way up the solid length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>of stair-carpet to Grandmamma’s withdrawing-room.</p>

<p>Mary preceded No. 88 Grosvenor Square, potato,
bone-hafted knife, sacking-cloth apron and all, into the
stately presence of the cap-with-lace-which-had-been-worn-by-Siddons.</p>

<p>“Lady Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth, Granny.”</p>

<p>The Bad Girl turned and fled; very nearly impaled
herself on the bone-hafted knife by counting fourteen
stairs instead of thirteen, and continuing her course
headlong until she fell howling into the arms of Cook.
But in Edward Bean’s goddaughter’s withdrawing-room
it was no laughing matter, my lords and gentlemen,
we feel bound to tell you that. And we are forced
to agree, though very reluctantly, with what Grandmamma
said privately to the Bad Girl afterwards, which
was that she would be none the worse for a good whipping.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cathcart, I presume?” said No. 88 Grosvenor
Square, very bland and splendid, although the tones
had no need to be so icy&mdash;they hadn’t, really.</p>

<p>“You have the advantage of me,” said the Lady
Macbeth to John Peter Kendall, offering her venerable
hand to the angle of 1851, the Exhibition Year. “Ah,
yes, Lady Shelmerdine&mdash;delighted to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>What of the Braided Morning Coat, you ask, while
all this was toward? Perspiring freely in every pore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>and leaning up against the chimney-piece, and looking
rather gray about the gills.</p>

<p>Should it make a bolt, or should it stay and grapple
with the music? The pusillanimity of the former
course, tempting no doubt to a weak resolution, would
involve death and damnation; but the heroism of the
latter required all that could be mustered by the playing
fields of Eton and Christ Church. But while the unhappy
inhabitant of the Braided Morning Coat was surrendered
to this problem, the stern, uncompromising eye
of Mother decided the question.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>“Ma-ter!” And then, of course, the Twin Brethren
called out the reserves. “Mrs. Cathcart&mdash;My
Mother.”</p>

<p>The bow of Grosvenor Square, No. 88, the corner
house, was aloof decidedly; the bow of the Lady Macbeth
to John Peter Kendall was so full of conscious
power and accumulated dignity that it was really quite
gracious.</p>

<p>“Pray be seated, Lady Shelmerdine.”</p>

<p>Beautiful elocution on the part of the goddaughter
of Edward Bean.</p>

<p>Lady Shelmerdine seated herself rather superbly, and
opened fire with her tortoise-shell folders.</p>

<p>The cap-with-lace-that-had-been-worn-by-Siddons
touched the electric button at its elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Entrance of the Bad Girl of the Family, without her
apron this time, and divested also of the potato and the
bone-hafted knife.</p>

<p>“Mary, child, my spectacles.”</p>

<p>The Bad Girl dived desperately in the inmost recesses
of the chiffonnier; found Grandmamma’s spectacles, and
prepared to withdraw in something of a hurry. But
she was detained.</p>

<p>“Has Jane returned, child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Granny.”</p>

<p>“Ask her to have the goodness to bring some tea for
Lady Shelmerdine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for me, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You are <i>quite</i> sure?”</p>

<p>No. 88 Grosvenor Square, the corner house, was quite,
quite sure. Exit the Bad Girl of the Family without
daring to look once in the direction of the Braided Morning
Coat that was still leaning up forlornly against the
chimney-piece.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cathcart,” said the Governing Classes, getting
the first gun in action, “I have done myself the honor
of calling upon you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The honor, madam, is entirely mine,” Edward
Bean’s goddaughter assured her.</p>

<p>“&mdash;because of a most unfortunate state of affairs
which has just been brought to my notice.”</p>

<p>The goddaughter of Edward Bean looked sympathetic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
although it doesn’t always do to judge by appearances,
you know.</p>

<p>“My unfortunate son&mdash;Phil-ipp, perhaps you will
be good enough to sit down, as it is most desirable that
you should follow what I say with the closest attention&mdash;my
unfortunate son, to the grief of his father, Lord
Shelmerdine, has made a proposal of marriage to your
niece.”</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth suggested mildly that granddaughter
might be more in accordance with the facts of the case.</p>

<p>“Granddaughter&mdash;I beg your pardon. One has
no need to tell <i>you</i>, Mrs. Cathcart, who, I am sure, are
a woman of the world, that this act of my son’s has
caused concern in his family.”</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth was sorry if that was the case.</p>

<p>“In point of fact, for some little time past my son
has been engaged to Lady Adela Rocklaw.”</p>

<p>“Not quite that, you know, Mater,” murmured the
unhappy Braided Morning Coat.</p>

<p>“&mdash;To Lady Adela Rocklaw, a daughter of Lord
Warlock, and his conduct will cause pain, although, of
course, madam, it has not yet become public property,
and I sincerely hope it may not become so.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t puttin’ it quite fair, are you, Mater?”
ventured the Braided Morning Coat.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp, please!” A wave of a she-proconsular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>hand. “Allow <i>me</i> to deal with the facts. A most embarrassing
situation, madam, for two families.”</p>

<p>“One moment, Lady Shelmerdine,” said Lady Macbeth.
“May I ask this question? Do I understand
your son to be actually <i>engaged</i> to Lady Adela Rocklaw?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, you may take that to be so.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine,” said the Queen of Tragedy, “I
must ask you for an explana-tion.”</p>

<p>Braided Morning Coat, notwithstanding that it was
feeling completely undone, unbuttoned itself nervously.</p>

<p>“The Mater’s a bit mixed, ma’am, and that’s the
truth. I am not engaged to Lady Adela.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Phil-ipp, not officially.”</p>

<p>“No, Mater, and not unofficially, and&mdash;” Herculean
effort by the Green Chartreuse&mdash;“I don’t mind
sayin’, I’ve no intention&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>“Lady Shelmerdine,” said the Queen of Tragedy,
“the situation is not altogether clear to my mind.
Either your son is engaged to marry Lady Adela Rocklaw,
or he is not.”</p>

<p>“He is morally engaged to her.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I am unable to appreciate the distinction.
Do I understand that your son is engaged to
Lady Adela?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I’m not,” said the Braided Morning
Coat with honorable boldness.</p>

<p>“But Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth, Mater. Mrs. Cathcart asks a plain
question, and there’s a plain answer. And after all,
I’m the chap&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said Lady Macbeth,
looking almost as wise as the Lord Chief Justice of
England as he sits in the Court of Appeal. “This is
your affair. You have a right to know your own mind&mdash;moreover,
you have a right to express it.”</p>

<p>The Braided Morning Coat felt the stronger for this
well-timed assistance. It was easy to see from which
side of the family Miss Mary had inherited her strong,
good sense. A masterful old thing, but she really was
helpin’ a lame dog over a stile, wasn’t she?</p>

<p>Blonder and blander grew the Colthurst of Suffolk.
It really looked as though it might be a pretty set-to.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Phil-ipp, if you looked into your club for
an hour&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Green Chartreuse, the horrid coward, wanted to
quit the stricken field prematurely. But if he had, as
sure as Fate, Mother would have won quite easily. Happily
he did not. Mr. Philip stuck to his guns like a
Briton, and Grandmamma at least thought none the
worse of him for it. The Lady Macbeth to John Peter
Kendall had an opinion of her own on nearly every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>subject; and the order of which the Braided Morning
Coat would one day be an ornament had in her judgment
to carry a rather serious penalty; but the old thing
in her shrewd old heart&mdash;an imperious old thing, too&mdash;who
had kept pretty good company for eighty-four
years or so, was not altogether inclined to accept all
the world and his wife at their surface valuation.</p>

<p>“The Family, madam,” said the Colthurst of Suffolk,
“is unable to countenance an alliance between
my unfortunate son and your granddaughter, who, one
is given to understand, is at present engaged in a pantomime.
I am, however, empowered by Lord Shelmerdine
to offer reparation if such is required.”</p>

<p>These were not the actual words used by Mother.
Her style was easier, a little less florid, a trifle more
conversational; but manner is said to be more eloquent
than matter in the higher diplomacy; thus the foregoing
represents more or less accurately the ultimatum of the
Governing Classes.</p>

<p>Grandmamma didn’t look pleased; at least not very.
The Florid Person was evidently taking herself rather
seriously. Let her Beware&mdash;that was all&mdash;quoth Conscious
Strength, amid the inner convolutions of the cap-of-real-lace-that-had-been-worn-by-Siddons.</p>

<p>“It appears to me, Lady Shelmerdine,” said the goddaughter
of Edward Bean, “that this is perhaps a
matter for your son and my granddaughter, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>no practical purpose will be served by third and fourth
parties discussing it&mdash;except, perhaps, in a spirit
purely academic.”</p>

<p>In a spirit purely academic! Well done, Peggy,
whispered the delighted shade of John Peter Kendall,
hovering somewhere in a cornice of the ceiling, immediately
above the bust of himself.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cathcart, as a woman of the world, and as
one who is in a position to appreciate the feelings of
a mother, I am sure I shall not appeal to you in
vain.”</p>

<p>When in doubt, saith the Diplomatist’s Handbook,
<i>Suaviter in Modo</i> is a card you should always play.
But how often has Grandmamma seen it, in the course of
her eighty-four summers, do you suppose?</p>

<p>It was here that the Braided Morning Coat felt it was
up to it to say something, and forthwith proceeded to
do so.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, ma’am,” said he. “It’s just a
matter for Mary and me. She won’t say Yes, and I
won’t take No, and there we are at present. But I’m
goin’ to ask her again, because I love her and all that,
and I know I’m not worthy of her&mdash;but I’m goin’ to
try to be, and I’m goin’ to see about Parliament at
once.”</p>

<p>The silence was ominous.</p>

<p>“That appears to be a perfectly manly and straightforward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
course to take, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said Grandmamma,
breaking the silence rather grimly.</p>

<p>Please observe that she didn’t tell Mother that she
declined to sanction the match. In the circumstances,
therefore, it is hardly kind to blame Mother for making
quite a number of errors.</p>

<p>Of course error the first was to come when Mr. Philip
was present in <i>propria persona</i>. But that, we are
afraid, was due to the aboriginal defect of a parent in
underrating the importance of its offspring. What she
ought to have done really, was to have come not as an
important unit of the Governing Classes, but to have
crept in by stealth, as it were, as the poor human mother
humbly craving assistance; and she ought to have kept
her foot on the soft pedal throughout the whole of the
concerto.</p>

<p>Alas! the manner of Mother’s coming had been otherwise.
And the longer she remained, the less she ought
to have said in order to realize the estimate she had
formed of her own wisdom&mdash;and when the spouse of
a great Proconsul is thinking imperially you can have
no idea how great that estimate is.</p>

<p>“Lord Shelmerdine empowers me to offer all reasonable
reparation.”</p>

<p>Grandmamma was interested to hear that in spite of
the fact that the whole matter was so purely academic.</p>

<p>“If there is any special form the young lady&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>haven’t the pleasure of the name of your niece, madam&mdash;would
desire the reparation to assume, Lord Shelmerdine’s
solicitor will be happy to call upon her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Mater&mdash;I say&mdash;”</p>

<p>Slight display of <i>Fortiter</i> in order to cope with this
unfilial interruption.</p>

<p>“It is your father’s wish, Philip.”</p>

<p>The ears of Grandmamma had seemed to cock a little
at the mention of Lord Shelmerdine’s solicitor.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, madam, if I appear dense,” said the
most perfect elocution.</p>

<p>Underplay a bit, Peggy my dear, like Fanny does in
genuine light comedy, said the Distinguished Shade,
smiling benevolently down from the cornice.</p>

<p>But this was the goddaughter of Bean, which perhaps
the Shade had forgotten.</p>

<p>“You are talkin’ rot, aren’t you, Mater?” said the
Braided Morning Coat in vibrant tones.</p>

<p>“It is your father’s wish, Phil-ipp. He desires that
no injustice&mdash;If thought desirable, reparation may
assume a pecuniary&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are talkin’ rot though, Mater, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>Incredible hardihood certainly on the part of the
Braided Morning Coat. But eminently honorable to
that chequered garment, perhaps the world is entitled
to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Lady Macbeth was not looking so very amenable just
now. A very masterful old thing in her way, and had
always been so. And really, Mother was a little crude
in places, wasn’t she?</p>

<p>Still, we are bound to do Mother the justice that she
was not aware of the fact. Indeed to her it seemed that
the higher diplomacy was really doing very well indeed.
Everything so pleasant, so agreeable; iron hand in velvet
glove, but used so lightly that Bohemian Circles
were hardly conscious of its presence. Mother was getting
on famous in her own opinion, and she ought to
have known.</p>

<p>Matrimony quite out of the question, of course, between
the granddaughter of Lady Macbeth and eldest
son of the House. The Governing Classes hoped that
that had been made quite clear to the wife of the Thane
of Cawdor.</p>

<p>The Wife of the Thane appeared to think it had been.</p>

<p>“Of a pecuniary character, I think you said?” said
the goddaughter of Edward Bean.</p>

<p>“Yes, pecuniary; Lord Shelmerdine has no reason
to think that Phil-ipp has been so unwise as to enter into
a formal engagement, but it is his desire to be quite fair,
even to be generous.”</p>

<p>Steady, Cavalry! whispered the Distinguished Shade
in the ear of Peggy.</p>

<p>“Or even generous, madam! One would be happy to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>have an idea of the shape Lord Shelmerdine’s generosity
might assume.”</p>

<p>The unhappy Braided Morning Coat regretted exceedingly
that it could not disclaim responsibility for
both parents.</p>

<p>“But, Mater&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“No, do not interrupt, dear Phil-ipp. This is all
<i>so</i> important and so delicate. Lord Shelmerdine thinks
five hundred pounds&mdash;and I am empowered&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then it was that Mother found Trouble.</p>

<p>Trouble came to Mother quite unexpected, like a bolt
from the blue&mdash;or like a shot out of a cannon, according
to the subsequent version of an eye-witness.</p>

<p>It would hardly be kind to describe the scene in detail.
Lady Macbeth, in spite of her eighty-four summers,
made rather short work of Mother. Not that
Mother was overborne by Christian meekness altogether.
Assured Social Position, knowing itself to be absolutely
right, and acting all for the best, does not always
offer the other cheek with perfect facility.</p>

<p>Please do not misunderstand us. It was hardly a
scene. The proprieties were observed with really Victorian
rigidity; it was all <i>very</i> grande dame; but one
being Lady Macbeth to John Peter Kendall, and the
other a leading Constitutional hostess who had recently
moved to Grosvenor Square, well&mdash;</p>

<p>Far from Mother’s intention to offer an affront to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>the granddaughter of Lady Macbeth. But Miss Footlight
of the Frivolity had quite recently received the
sum of ten thousand pounds from the people of young
Lord Footle, which sum was of course excessive, as dear
Justice Brusher had said to Mother at dinner last evening.</p>

<p>“Madam, I hold no opinion of Justice Brusher; Miss
Footlight I don’t know, and Lord Footle I don’t desire
to know; but it is impossible for my granddaughter, a
member of an old theatrical family, to pocket this insult.”</p>

<p>And Grandmamma rang the bell with tremendous
dignity.</p>

<p>Jane the parlor-maid it was who appeared this time,
looking all the prettier for her afternoon out.</p>

<p>“Jane,” said the acknowledged Queen of Tragedy,
“pray conduct Lady Shelmerdine to her carriage&mdash;and
in future I do not receive her.”</p>

<p>Poor old Mother! And in her new ermine tippet,
too.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp, accompany me.”</p>

<p>Philip accompanied Mother down the stairs, past the
bust of Bean in the front hall, down the nine steps of
Number Ten Bedford Gardens, and handed her into her
carriage.</p>

<p>“We dine at eight this evening, Philip. Your father
will expect you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Impossible, Mater. Dinin’ at the Old Players’
Club.”</p>

<p>To give the Governing Classes their due, they certainly
made exit in pretty good style from Bohemia.
As for Mr. Philip, he returned to the front hall to retrieve
his hat and his coat with the astrachan collar and
other belongings, and wondered if it would be wise to
say good-by to Grandmamma, and decided that perhaps
he had better not risk it. But before he could get
into his famous garment, the Bad Girl of the Family
descended upon him from the basement&mdash;we are not
quite sure how she managed to do it, but simple little
feats in elementary acrobatics are always possible to
a pantomime performer&mdash;and haled the young man
by main force into what she called her Private Piggery,
which in reality was a small back parlor of sorts in an
indescribable state of confusion.</p>

<p>Having brought the froward young man to this undesirable
bourn, the Bad Girl turned up the electric
light, and then without any warning proceeded to fall
into a state that bordered upon tears and general collapse.</p>

<p>The heir to the barony was not feeling so very
amused just now, though.</p>

<p>“My opinion you were listening, you cat.”</p>

<p>“Granny&mdash;the dreadful old spitfire!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Tactless of the Mater I’ll admit. Quite well meant
though, Polly.”</p>

<p>“How dare you call me Polly after all that has happened!”
And the youngest member of the old theatrical
family whisked away her tears with a rather smart
lace-broidered handkerchief, and looked almost as
fierce as the Cat in the moral drama of <i>Dick Whittington</i>.</p>

<p>“Howlin’ blunder, I’ll admit; but you aren’t crabbed
about it, are you, old girl?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t admit anything, Mr. Shelmerdine&mdash;and
how dare you call me old girl after what has happened?
Don’t let me have to ring for Jane and not
receive you in future&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So you <i>were</i> listening, you cat!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you have been&mdash;Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“It is a horrid mix-up though, isn’t it? Look here,
old girl, I really think the best thing we can do is to go
and get married to-morrow mornin’ before the Registrar.”</p>

<p>Cinderella seemed to think, however, that such a proposal
was not in the plane of practical politics.</p>

<p>“I know, old girl, that a Church is considered a bit
more respectable; but I thought that the Registrar
would be quicker and easier.”</p>

<p>“You are rather taking it for granted, aren’t you,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>Philip, that I’m going to marry you, when you know
I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do think, Polly, after all that has happened&mdash;!”</p>

<p>But somehow Polly didn’t quite see it in that way.
She couldn’t think of such a thing without the consent
of Granny. And even if Granny did consent&mdash;which,
of course, her consent would never be given, his people
would never give theirs, would they? so that even that
would not make their prospects any rosier.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were goin’ to be a pal to me,
Polly!”</p>

<p>“So I am, Phil-ipp, but I mustn’t marry you, must
I, against the wishes of your People.”</p>

<p>It was hard for a young man of inexperience to know
exactly how much was meant by the Bad Girl of the
Family when she was in this kind of humor. But whatever
doubts that were in his mind, he suddenly laid hold
of her quite firmly and kissed her quite soundly, and,
strictly between ourselves, you young bachelors of Cam
and Isis, that was just about the best thing he could
have done in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the young man was still involved pretty
deeply in the crisis of his fate. Bliss unspeakable was
so nearly within his grasp, and yet it was so elusive.
He was not without the rudiments of determination, and
he had fully made up his mind that this was the girl for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>him, but just now he really didn’t quite know how he
was to enter his kingdom.</p>

<p>Decidedly he must pluck this peach, and he must
pluck it immediately. But how?&mdash;that was the problem,
with the Fates having loaded the dice.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH WE SIT AT THE FEET OF GAMALIEL</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morrow, or about midnight that same day, to
be precise, when Arminius Wingrove came into the club
after attending an important <i>première</i>, the great man
was engaged in conversation by Mr. Philip while they
dallied with devilled kidneys and other comestibles.</p>

<p>“Minnie,” said the vain young fellow, “everybody
says you are the cleverest chap in London, so I want
your advice.”</p>

<p>Rather cool, perhaps, to demand advice of the cleverest
chap in London in this point-blank manner, but
Arminius, who kept a generous heart beneath his waistcoat
of white piquè, showed no displeasure.</p>

<p>“If you mean about the girl you are making a fool
of yourself over,” said the great man, “<i>don’t</i>, is the
advice I shall have to give you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’ve got beyond that already,” said the
vain young fellow with a rather grand simplicity.</p>

<p>“Have you, though?” said Arminius, pensive-like.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m goin’ to marry her if she’ll have me, but
the trouble is, she won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t she, though!” said Arminius, looking rather
like the statuette of himself by Sir W. G-sc-mbe J-hn.</p>

<p>“No, she won’t, Minnie, and that’s all about it, until
her old grandmother gives her consent; and the old
lady simply won’t hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Who is her old grandmother?” inquired Arminius,
“and why won’t she?”</p>

<p>“Her grandmother is Mrs. Cathcart, who played
Lady Macbeth with David Garrick, and she’s taken a
prejudice against me because I’m the son of a peer.”</p>

<p>The manner of Arminius seemed to imply that old
Mrs. Cathcart had been guilty of a very unfeminine
proceeding. But being a disciple of Talleyrand, the
great man did not clothe his thoughts with words.</p>

<p>“And to make matters worse, Minnie, there was a
simply frightful turn-up between her grandmother and
my Mater yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>With the flair of a playwright whom Hannibal had
himself approved, Arminius Wingrove asked for further
information.</p>

<p>“Simply gorgeous, Minnie, for a chap who hadn’t
to be in it. Wouldn’t have missed it for worlds&mdash;except
that I kind of wasn’t in a position to enjoy it, was
I? But it hasn’t half crabbed the piece! Tragedy
Queen ordered Mater out of the house, and says she
shan’t receive her in future. So it’s all up with my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>people, and I’m afraid it’s all up with hers; and the
girl isn’t going to marry me without the consent of all
parties.”</p>

<p>The statement of the vain young fellow seemed both
florid and ingenuous to Arminius Wingrove, who had
hardly been so much amused by anything since the revival
of <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>.</p>

<p>“And so you don’t think she’ll marry you, do you,
my son?”</p>

<p>Arminius Wingrove had not a mercenary nature, but
he wouldn’t mind laying a “pony” on the event. The
heart of the heir to the barony gave a bound.</p>

<p>“Why, what reason have you to think so, Minnie?”
he said in a voice of tense emotion.</p>

<p>“Because there’s not half a reason why she shouldn’t,
my lad.”</p>

<p>“But she is simply devoted to her old grandmother.”</p>

<p>“The old lady has all her faculties, I presume?”</p>

<p>“My Mater thinks so, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, there’s not half a reason why the girl
shouldn’t marry you.”</p>

<p>Still the reasoning of Arminius Wingrove was not
altogether clear to the heir to the barony, who, to be
sure, was somewhat slow in the uptake.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose, young feller, that any girl’s
grandmother would stand in the way of forty thousand
a year and a peerage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Minnie! She’s not that sort of girl; and she’s
not that sort of grandmother. It is the confounded
peerage that has crabbed the piece.”</p>

<p>Polite incredulity on the part of the audience.</p>

<p>“Minnie, old boy, everybody says you are the cleverest
chap in London, but you don’t know Mary Caspar.”</p>

<p>Arminius Wingrove knew something about Woman,
though.</p>

<p>No, ladies&mdash;not a cynical ruffian altogether. His
heart was in the right place even though he took this
mercantile view. Therefore, by the time the Welsh
rarebit arrived the great man conceived it to be his
duty to dispense something extra superior in the way of
advice.</p>

<p>“Young Shelmerdine,” said he, “what the dooce do
you want to go foolin’ around the stage door at all for?
A chap like you ought to marry Adela Rocklaw. Make
things unpleasant at home. No longer be welcomed in
the best houses. Bored to tears about the second week
of the honeymoon. Opportunities squandered. Much
better have stayed in the Second, and gone racing quietly
than to have come into money and to have broken out in
this way. Now take the advice of a friend; and let
us see you at the Church of Paul or of Peter at an
early date awaiting the arrival of old Warlock’s seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and most attractive daughter, and I will have
my hat ironed, and be proud to accompany you down
the nave of the cathedral.”</p>

<p>It was not often that this man of the world was
moved in this way; but he had just staged a rattling
good comedy, and devilled kidneys and Welsh rarebits
and tankards of strong ale are rather stimulating diet,
when you sit listening to the chimes at midnight. It is
a disconcerting psychological fact, though, that no
young man has ever heeded the voice of wisdom in these
circumstances.</p>

<p>“It is awful good of you, Minnie, to take the trouble
to advise me, but I’m goin’ to marry Mary Caspar
if flesh and blood can manage it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a walk-over for flesh and blood, you silly
young fool,” said Arminius Wingrove with rather
brutal frankness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH THE MOUNTAIN COMES TO<br />
MAHOMET</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Philip</span> found an imperious mandate from Grosvenor
Square had been laid beside his silver cigar-box
when he returned to the Albany at a quarter past two
by the morning. It ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“Dear Philip,&mdash;Your father desires to see you most
particularly upon important business at ten o’clock to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p class="right">“Your loving Mother.”</p></div>

<p>“She means this mornin’, and I shan’t be up if I
don’t go to bed soon,” said the heir to the barony, sitting
down before the remains of the fire to consider the
situation in all its bearings.</p>

<p>The melancholy consequence was that not all the
King’s horses and not all the King’s men, including the
young man’s body servant, were able to wake him until
a few minutes before eleven, in spite of the fact that a
special messenger had been round from the Home Department.</p>

<p>If, however, Mahomet declines to move, it is time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>for the Mountain to be up and doing. Therefore, just
as Mr. Philip, enveloped in a sky-blue dressing-gown,
was pouring out his coffee with an uncertain hand,
something rather portentous was ushered into the presence
of the wicked young prodigal.</p>

<p>The white eyebrows of the great Proconsul were a
triumph of brushwork; the set of the tie was stern
uncommonly; indeed, the whole paternal aspect was
enough to strike awe in the heart of the beholder.</p>

<p>The evidence that it did so, however, is not altogether
conclusive.</p>

<p>The young waster buttering his toast at a quarter-past
eleven in a sky-blue dressing-gown, rose and offered
his hand in an easy and leisurely, but withal in a
manly and unaffected fashion.</p>

<p>“I was just comin’ round, father,” said the young
man.</p>

<p>Father declined a cup of coffee and a cigarette without
any effervescence of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Take a pew, won’t you?” said the young man, returning
to his toast and butter.</p>

<p>Cool and off-handed young fellow, perhaps, thus to
receive a great Proconsul, still his tone was not without
deference, even if his air was casual.</p>

<p>Father took a pew.</p>

<p>“You don’t look very comfy in that one. Take the
one with the arms to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Do quite well, thanks,” said Father, in a deep bass
voice.</p>

<p>A state of armed neutrality?&mdash;ye-es, it did seem
rather like it. Father didn’t seem quite to know
where to begin: Son knew better than to provide assistance.</p>

<p>“See in the paper that Van rather got across old
Balsquith last night?” said Son conversationally.</p>

<p>Father had heard the debate from the Peers’ Gallery.</p>

<p>Son wondered what would win the Coronation Vase&mdash;havin’
forgotten that Father didn’t go racin’.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said Father, in tones of deep emotion, “it
seems to me that you&mdash;” And Father paused.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are going to the Devil as fast as you can, is
really what your distinguished parent desires to say
to you, but he is trying to say it without treading on
your feelings, which is more consideration than you
deserve, you blighter!&mdash;thus the Twin Brethren for
the personal information of the Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>No business of his if I am, was the very unfilial rejoinder
of the latter.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said Father, after a pause, “your mother
is very upset.”</p>

<p>Young fellow was sorry to hear it&mdash;very, but the
weather is always so full of surprises in February.</p>

<p>Mother had not yet recovered, it appeared, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>most painful scene last Sunday afternoon with the
grandmother of the Person.</p>

<p>As the occurrence had been reported to the great
Proconsul, the Person’s venerable relative had not behaved
as nicely as she might have done.</p>

<p>Son was awfully cut up about it, but he didn’t quite
agree. With all respect to Mother, he could not help
thinking that Miss Caspar’s venerable relative had been
in receipt of provocation.</p>

<p>White eyebrows erected themselves archwise.</p>

<p>“But we won’t go into That,” said Father.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be better not, said the Green
Chartreuse in an aside to Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell’s
marmalade.</p>

<p>Very disagreeable, though, thought Father, and very
serious, too. There was nothing more painful to a
right-thinking parent than to see a son&mdash;and an Eldest
Son, too&mdash;making hay of his prospects.</p>

<p>Didn’t quite agree again with his father. The Green
Chartreuse was suffering evidently from an attack of
valor this morning.</p>

<p>“But there are the facts, my dear boy. Let them
be looked in the face.”</p>

<p>“I wish, father, you would consent to meet Mary.
She’s an absolute nailer, you know.”</p>

<p>Father was so disconcerted by the behavior of Son
that he kind of began to clothe his thoughts with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>language. A singularly unfortunate entanglement;
people would be shocked; family interests would suffer;
such unions never turned out well&mdash;how could they?
Besides, Warlock was so sensitive. In fact, with all
the conviction of which he was capable&mdash;and a Proconsul
is capable of a good deal&mdash;Father urged Son to
pause and reflect.</p>

<p>Son had already done so.</p>

<p>Was it conceivable?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, quite, if Father didn’t mind his saying so.
He had a private income, and she was the nicest girl in
London; an opinion, he was sure, in which Father was
bound to concur, when he’d seen her.</p>

<p>But...!!</p>

<p>Yes, but people were getting so much broader-minded,
weren’t they?</p>

<p>Father had heard that that was the case; but in his
opinion excess of breadth was an even more serious
menace to the Empire&mdash;being a great Proconsul, of
course, Father always thought Imperially&mdash;than to err
a little on the other side.</p>

<p>If you looked at things in that way, thought Mr.
Philip.</p>

<p>Don’t cheek your father and a proconsul, too, you
young bounder, said the Twin Brethren.</p>

<p>Don’t let those eyebrows overawe you, my son, said
the Green Chartreuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>How else could one look at things? the Proconsul
inquired in tones of pained expostulation.</p>

<p>“This is the way I look at things, father,” said Mr.
Philip, “if you don’t mind my goin’ into details.”</p>

<p>“Pray do so, my boy. I shall welcome them.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is my feelin’ on the subject. You are
sort of shot here, don’t you know, without anybody
askin’ you whether you wanted to come. You are sort
of dumped here, don’t you know, and told to make the
best of a pretty bad mix-up. Well, I don’t mind tellin’
you, father, I’ve been gettin’ rather fed up with the
whole Affair lately.”</p>

<p>An idle and selfish course of life leads invariably to
that state of mind, said Father in effect, though his
language was politer. It was a great mistake ever to
have left the Second.</p>

<p>Son had got just as fed up there, though. It seemed
such a silly arrangement for grown men of five-and-twenty.</p>

<p>Father was pained at This.</p>

<p>“Fact is,” said the Green Chartreuse, who was a
veritable Swaggering Companion this morning, “a
chap is bound to get fed up unless he can find a real
nice girl to take him on, and give him an interest in
things. And I reckon I’ve found her, although I
haven’t persuaded her yet; but, father, if you’ll be so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>kind as to go and talk to her grandmother, a real good
sort who has played Bean with Lady Macbeth, and put
in a word for me, I’m sure it would straighten things
out a bit.”</p>

<p>Father was constrained to remark at this point that
he was afraid the Eldest Son of the House was hopeless.
It was truly unfortunate that he could not be
brought to realize the gravity of the issue.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip seemed willing to concede that from one
point of view it would be quite right to marry Adela.
But suppose you were not built in that way?</p>

<p>Father, however, found not the least difficulty in making
a rejoinder. “Marry Adela, my dear boy, whatever
way you are built in, and you will never regret it.
You will have done your duty in a manner becoming to
the sphere to which it has pleased Providence to call
you. Your mother will be pleased; I propose to double
your present income; Warlock is prepared to be generous
in regard to Adela’s settlement; I am sure High
Cliff will view the arrangement favorably; the little
house in Grosvenor Street can be had on a short lease
on reasonable terms; Mr. Vandeleur is inclined to think
it would do no harm to the Party; most agreeable, accomplished,
and charming girl; what could any young
fellow&mdash;but why labor the point?”</p>

<p>Son rather agreed that it might be taken as read.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>
<p>Still the fact remained that if you are not built in
that way you are bound to be up against it.</p>

<p>The Proconsul had no pity for such weakness of
fiber, such general infirmity of character.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose, my dear boy, that when I married
your dear mother I had no qualms?”</p>

<p>It may have been that this important truth was wrung
from the great Proconsul before he realized its imminence.
It was a period of considerable emotional
stress just now, you must please remember.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I did not realize that my life was
not going to be altogether a bed of roses at first? But
I am proud to say I was ambitious, and I can look all the
world in the face and say I have never regretted my
action. Our life together has been exceedingly harmonious;
your mother is a most estimable and a thoroughly
<i>good</i> woman; and I should have been guilty of
the greatest error of my career had I allowed any infirmity
of purpose to frustrate a union which has been
so abundantly blessed by heaven.”</p>

<p>Seldom had the great Proconsul been moved so
deeply.</p>

<p>“Let us beware, my dear boy, lest the weakening of
fiber of the present generation does not undermine our
Empire. Pray do not think for one single moment that
you will ever regret a union with Adela Rocklaw. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>for this other step, I assure you, my dear boy, it is unthinkable.”</p>

<p>Having thus unburdened his mind, the Proconsul
rose, and, still the prey of deep emotion, swayed majestically
forth of the Albany B4.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH WE ARE TAKEN TO VIEW A LITTLE<br />
FLAT IN KNIGHTSBRIDGE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Philip</span> felt rather limp after the state visit.</p>

<p>“How happy I should be if I were not the son of
my father!” was the somewhat unfilial tenor of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Still, he mustered the courage to take Mary out to
lunch, but he didn’t refer to the recent interview with
the Proconsul.</p>

<p>“When is your time up at the Lane, old girl?” inquired
the vain young man.</p>

<p>“Quite soon now, Phil-ipp.”</p>

<p>“And then what are you doin’?”</p>

<p>“I am going to take Gran’ma to Brighton for a
fortnight, and then I’m going to tour the provinces as
Lady Agatha in <i>Kind Hearts and Coronets</i>, until Mr.
Wingrove’s new play is put into rehearsal at the Millennium.”</p>

<p>Mr. Philip had ordered half a bottle of Number 68, it
is rather important to mention, although it had gone
up half-a-crown in spite of the fact that some people
think it is quite expensive enough already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Goin’ to be leadin’ a full life, ain’t you, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Seems like it, doesn’t it, Phil-ipp!”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you ought to turn up those beastly
provinces, I do really. You are much too good for
’em. I don’t know much about it, of course, but it
seems to me that such art as yours is wasted on the bally
provinces.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Phil-ipp,” said Mary the
demure. “But I love the dear old things.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, Polly, I should never play out of
London, if I had to play at all.”</p>

<p>Polly admitted there might be something in this view.
Still, she would miss the dear old provinces terribly, and
perhaps they might miss her.</p>

<p>And then Number 68 began to display considerable
boldness.</p>

<p>“There’s a little flat in Knightsbridge, a toppin’
little hole, that I think we might go round and look at,
old girl, don’t you? Very cheap for the position and
the landlord will paint it throughout, and we can have
possession any time we want it.”</p>

<p>Polly didn’t mind going to look at it, as she rather
liked looking over such things.</p>

<p>The flat was charming. A little high up, perhaps,
but there were two delightful rooms that overlooked the
park. It was one of the most tempting spots in the
metropolis. Yet there was one serious drawback, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>in the opinion of Philip, however, was almost a merit.
It was likely to be much sought after, said the house-agent;
any delay in taking it might be fatal. They
could only be allowed a week in which to make up their
minds.</p>

<p>Yes, the flat was charming, they agreed, as they
walked up Piccadilly. And only a week in which to
make up their minds! Still, that was rather providential,
if you looked at it from Philip’s point of view.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to make up our minds at once, haven’t
we?”</p>

<p>“I’ve made up my mind already, Phil-ipp. It is
the very place for you; so much moderner and pleasanter
and lighter than your chambers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old girl, but I shouldn’t think of it for a
moment without you.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>A bald reason, perchance, but a manly conviction had
given it currency.</p>

<p>“But that’s absurd, Phil-ipp. Why should a mere
chorus girl&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Polly,” said the fierce young man, “you
mustn’t suppose I’m going to be chipped by you. If
I take that flat, you’ve got to come and live in it; and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>Polly”&mdash;and for all they were just opposite the Burlington
Arcade, the vain young man took a firm grip of
the arm of Mary the obdurate&mdash;“I’m bally well goin’
to take that flat.”</p>

<p>“Are you, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m goin’ to take it now.”</p>

<p>“What!&mdash;now, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“At once. Come on back to the house-agents.”</p>

<p>“But they are half-a-mile away, Phil-ipp.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; it’s a nice day for a walk.”</p>

<p>“But what about Granny? and what about the great
Proconsul; and what about Lady Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let ’em go to blazes&mdash;that is, old girl, I beg
pardon.”</p>

<p>“I should just hope so. And let go my arm,
Phil-ipp; people are looking at us.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s cut back again.”</p>

<p>“But, Phil-ipp.”</p>

<p>“You said yourself that it was the nicest position in
London, and only nine hundred and fifty a year, which
seems rather ridiculous, considerin’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Considering what, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“Considerin’ the way they stick you for three rooms
and a private bathroom.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Phil-ipp, but then think of the address!”</p>

<p>Never, however, in the whole course of his career,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>not even when he had scored those three goals against
Scotland, had Mr. Philip shown more invincible determination
than at this moment. If there was not to
be a scene in Piccadilly and a paragraph in the evening
papers, Mary would have to do as she was told.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp, you are behaving anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Less of it, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Less of what, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>“Your cheek&mdash;you cat.”</p>

<p>Unbridled insolence, which we are sure no girl of
refined instincts and decent nurture&mdash;do you think so,
Madam? All the same, that is the manner in which
Phil-ipp admonished her, and her salary was a hundred
a week, and was likely to be two hundred presently;
and the ex-non-commissioned officer on duty at the entrance
to the Burlington Arcade pricked up his ears
disapprovingly at such language being used to a lady;
and his trained observation told him she <i>was</i> a lady,
although her face had rather more powder on it than
it ought to have had; and he wondered whether he
would have permitted himself to use such language in
such circumstances when he was a young chap in the
Guards with one stripe a-courtin’ the Missus; and
whether the Missus would have had him in spite of his
uniform if he had courted her in that way; and
whether she wouldn’t have been quite right; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>whether anybody knew what things were comin’ to, because
he was quite sure that he didn’t. And yes, there
the young chap had got hold of her arm again, and,
strike his lucky! they were chipping each other like
one o’clock; and a dashed pretty girl, and not a bad-looking
young chap either. And what were the pair o’
turtledoves&mdash;as of course a chap of his experience
could see with half an eye&mdash;quarrelling about? No,
not quarrelling exactly, but chipping each other and
cross-talking somewhat. And what was it all about?
Why, a flat in Knightsbridge. You ’ave it, miss, and
be thankful for the chawnce, and think yourself fortunate,
which of course you are; and so is he if he gets
<i>you</i> to go and arrange the flowers in the vases for him.</p>

<p>Down the street again they are going now, though,
yet still conducting their heated argument. Granny
would be furious, and so would Mother. And Father
would cut him out of the succession&mdash;which of course he
couldn’t; and that, perhaps, was almost a pity. She
would have to give up the provinces and break her contracts,
and everything would be so uncomfortable for
everybody&mdash;</p>

<p>“Except, old girl, for you and me.”</p>

<p>“But that’s rather selfish, isn’t it, Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>Phil-ipp dared say it was a little, but yet not altogether,
because, after all, it was the way of human nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Not a very conclusive piece of reasoning, young
fellow, but Mistress Polly was bound to admit that,
superficial as it was, it would bear thinking upon.</p>

<p>“Be a pal to me, Polly, and I’ll be a pal to you, old
girl, and we’ll be as happy as the birds in the springtime;
and you’ll see that my people will come round all
right, and you’ll see that Granny will forgive you!”</p>

<p>And here they were at the office of Messrs. Thompson
and Allardyce in Wilton Place&mdash;not so far from the
Church. And Phil-ipp informed a polite young man,
with quite the Oxford manner, that they’d take that flat
on a three years’ lease from Lady Day&mdash;and that, my
lords and gentlemen, was how the trick was done. For
by the time they had bade adieu to the polite young
man with the Oxford manner they were as good as
married.</p>

<p>At least, Phil-ipp seemed to think they were. A little
previous, perhaps, young fellow; but when you are
proceeding full steam ahead at rather more than nine
knots an hour, you are rather apt to get a little in
front of the time-table, are you not?</p>

<p>“That’s the very old thing for us,” said Phil-ipp,
waving his hand across at the Church. “And I say,
old girl, let us see if we can’t persuade Granny to give
a reception at the Hyde Park Hotel; and I’ll persuade
old Min Wingrove to bring all the brightest people in
London, and we shall rather wipe the eye of No. 88,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>the corner house, old girl, shan’t we, when they see the
pictures in the papers?”</p>

<p>“I shall rather like to see you persuading Granny,
though, Phil-ipp, particularly after what has occurred.”</p>

<p>But Phil-ipp affirmed his manly determination to take
the risk, especially as Polly desired to bet a shilling that
he daren’t.</p>

<p>“Done with you. And I’m hanged if we won’t go
right away and tackle her.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the imperious young man, who was revealing
a whole gamut of unexpected qualities, bundled
Polly straight into a taxi, demanded to be driven to
10 Bedford Gardens&mdash;that magic address&mdash;and got
in himself.</p>

<p>“I say, old girl,” said he, as they sped past the windows
of the Button Club, “little Marge can be one of
your bridesmaids, can’t she?”</p>

<p>“Goose,” said Mary.</p>

<p>Yes, and a big one, to be scientifically accurate; yet
the proudest and happiest young fellow in all the metropolis
just now, possessed by the demon of Damn the
Consequences.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DAMNED<br />
WITH NO UNCERTAINTY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffins</span> and Chayney Tea in Grandmamma’s withdrawing-room
were not out of place, because the
afternoon had been really so strenuous; moreover, Grandmamma
herself did not appear to view the guilty pair
with the eye of disfavor. But that was breeding, doubtless.
Not that Mr. Philip entered into any exhaustive
inquiry. When you are in the seventh heaven, even the
eye of Edward Bean’s goddaughter may be bereft of
some of its terrors.</p>

<p>“We had such a lovely lunch at Pagani’s, Granny
dear.”</p>

<p>“Had you, my dear? How interesting!”</p>

<p>Did Granny mean it was interesting, or did she mean
it wasn’t? You see, you never quite know&mdash;do you?&mdash;when
the elocution of old ladies who have kept pretty
good company for about eighty-four summers is so very
clear-cut.</p>

<p>“And what do you think, Granny? I have been
with Phil-ipp to take a perfectly lovely little flat on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>three years’ lease in Knightsbridge, overlooking the
park.”</p>

<p>“With whom have you been, my dear?”</p>

<p>Now we do think that was just a little unkind of
Granny, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mary’s elocution, though, in the opinion of Mr.
Hollins&mdash;and he’s an authority&mdash;was worth two hundred
a week to the Lane; so it came in very useful just
now, and showed that she was not going to be put out of
court as easily as all that.</p>

<p>“With Phil-ipp, Granny dear.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shelmerdine, I presume, my dear.”</p>

<p>Granny’s presumption was correct; and a few more
muffins were indicated, Mary seemed to think, for all
that her lunch at Pagani’s had been so terrific.</p>

<p>All this was merely brushing the ice; it was not
really breaking it; and who was going to break it was
the problem that now was exercising the manly bosom
of Philip. However, they would await that further
relay of muffins before they ventured on the pickaxe
act.</p>

<p>Muffins with a little salt sprinkled upon ’em do splendidly
with Chayney tea, even after a toppin’ little
lunch at Pagani’s. Sometimes, that is. Rather depends,
you know, on what quarter the moon is in, and
whether Mars and Venus are in conjunction, and Jupiter
is in the First House, and the Sun is in Aries, and so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>on. But given that all these signs and portents are
favorable, there is really no reason why muffins and salt
and Chayney tea should not be perfectly delectable in
Granny’s withdrawing-room at twenty minutes past
four, even after a champagne luncheon at Pagani’s at
a quarter to two.</p>

<p>The planetary bodies have been behaving quite
nicely this afternoon, so far. Let us hope they will
continue to do so.</p>

<p>Jupiter was in the First House, you must please remember;
and it was not less than he, as of course the
discerning reader has known from the first, who ruled
the destinies of this daughter of good fortune who had
been endowed with every grace. Therefore it need surprise
no one that Mary received a special message by
wireless with her second cup of Chayney tea.</p>

<p>“Take Granny into your confidence now, my dear,”
ran the message. “She has had quite a nice nap; her
rheumatism has scarcely troubled her at all to-day;
she can’t help liking your Phil-ipp, although she has
tried her hardest not to; and she is rather inclined to
think that it may do no harm to teach&mdash;”</p>

<p>Yes, it is doubtless right to keep that part of the
message off the records at present.</p>

<p>Mary flung her arms round the neck of Granny, in
perilous contiguity to the real-lace-of-Siddons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“What would you say if Phil-ipp and I were to get
married, Granny&mdash;quite soon&mdash;and we had a sort of
a little honeymoon at Brighton with you?”</p>

<p>This was the pickaxe with a vengeance, Miss Mary.
Jupiter was very much in the First House this afternoon.</p>

<p>Granny did not say anything immediately. Still,
having had a good nap, she sustained the inquiry with
admirable composure.</p>

<p>“Very precipitate, my dear, and very unwise, I fear.
Have you given sufficient consideration to the Step?”</p>

<p>“We’ve both thought it over, ma’am,” said Mr.
Philip, who really felt he was walking on air just now.</p>

<p>“The Step seems singularly unwise to me, Mr. Shelmerdine.”</p>

<p>“Why does it, Granny?”</p>

<p>“The reasons, my dear, are many and hardly such
as to call for enumeration. In the first place, I understand
that Mr. Shelmerdine’s family is much opposed to
the Match.”</p>

<p>“They are bound to come round, ma’am if we give
them time,” said Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>Grandmamma was not so optimistic.</p>

<p>“Not, of course, Mr. Shelmerdine, if you will permit
me to say so, that in the circumstances one regards
the sanction of your parents as a <i>sine quâ non</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>The young man concurred with Grandmamma, more
explicitly perhaps than he ought to have done.</p>

<p>“And then there is the question of your vocation,
Mr. Shelmerdine. You have none at present, I understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to see about Parliament at once, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Grandmamma was bound to admit that the State of
Things was not wholly satisfactory to her, but she had
had a good nap, and Jupiter was in the First House,
and it would really do no harm to Mary to retire from
Pantomime and marry a nice young man&mdash;which this
young man appeared to be, in spite of his mother.
Moreover, Grandmamma, being an old lady of spirit,
was not altogether averse from teaching some people a
lesson. So if she didn’t say Yes with any degree of
enthusiasm, she didn’t say No with any measure of conviction.
She belonged to a bygone age which looked
at things rather differently from the present one; but
if young people wanted very much to marry, old people
should not interfere more than was really necessary.
All of which goes to show that when Grandmamma had
had a good nap and Jupiter was in the First House, she
could be as wise and broad-minded as any other old
lady.</p>

<p>Still, Grandmamma was afraid that things had altered
strangely since her time; but this was a nice young
man, in spite of his unfilial attitude; and if a girl really
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>felt she had to marry, there can be nothing so very
wrong in marrying a nice young man. But things had
altered since her time, thought Granny. Nice young
men hardly behaved in this way in 1851, the Exhibition
year; which rather goes to show, we are afraid, that the
wisest of old ladies are as prone to misread the signs
and portents as the lesser mortals.</p>

<p>Mary and Philip, however, kept their exuberance for
a crowded and glorious five minutes in the Private Piggery,
wherein the lucky young dog inveigled himself
for the purpose of putting on the coat with the astrachan
collar.</p>

<p>“We must get it all fixed up at once, old girl, and
we’ll waste no time about it. We’ll do it in style, at a
church, don’t you think? Not of course that I don’t
prefer the other way, like any other chap if he had his
choice, but that’s a bit rough on the girl, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mary thought he was rather a dear to think of the
Girl’s side; and he thought that she was rather a dear
to think that he could be a dear for thinking of his
obvious duty. And there they were, you see. Now
please don’t be cynical, you young ladies of Newnham
and Girton; it will be your turn presently, and when it
comes, my dears, take the advice of your Uncle John,
and behave as much as you can like Philip and Mary.
But see that the door of the Private Piggery is closed
when Jane is passing, otherwise it may have a tendency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>to put ideas in the heads of pretty young parlor-maids,
and Grandmamma has found occasion to tell Miss Jane
privately more than once that she has quite sufficient
of Those already.</p>

<p>“We’ll send out invitations for anywhere you like,
old girl, and we’ll get old Minnie Wingrove to collect
all the brightest people in London; and the papers will
make such a fuss that we shan’t half wipe the eye of
Grosvenor Square, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Naughty Phil-ipp. You mustn’t never wipe the
eye of no one.”</p>

<p>Still, she had rather forgotten, hadn’t she, young
ladies of Newnham and Girton, that Mr. Philip was
not yet an archangel in a large way of trade, although
apparently that was her ambition for him. But you
won’t think any the worse of her, will you? It’s all in
the game, my dears, and a very nice game, too, if you
play it slowly.</p>

<p>How long would it take her to get her trousseau?</p>

<p>No, you young bachelors of Cam and Isis, that was
not a clever question. But one must expect this sort
of thing of an amateur now and then. Philip, young
friend, your inquiry should have been differently expressed.</p>

<p>And what was Mary’s answer to the foolish question?
Why, just what yours would have been, young
ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Mary didn’t know how long it would take her to get
her trousseau.</p>

<p>We agree with you, my dears, that only a perfect
Silly would have been guilty of any such inquiry.</p>

<p>Should they go to Algiers for the honeymoon?</p>

<p>“Yes, Phil-ipp, but who is going to look after
Granny at Brighton? She goes there every March,
you know, by advice.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Brighton, then,” said Philip, “or a
tour round the world, or anywhere.”</p>

<p>So they left it at that; and the lucky young dog proceeded
on foot to the nearest of his clubs, for all that he
felt like an airship really; and engaged in a game of
snooker pool with two eminent criminal barristers&mdash;that
is to say, two eminent members of the Common Law
Bar&mdash;and was very soon the poorer by the sum of two
pounds sterling.</p>

<p>Then the young man sat down and wrote a little line
to Mary, which ran to four pages, and was absolutely
superfluous, because it was really about nothing at all
except to remind her that she was the dearest and best,
etc. Fortunately he had the good sense to tear it up,
so that not one was a penny the worse for an ill-written,
and miss-spelt, and hopelessly ungrammatical effusion,
and that notwithstanding that the writer had enjoyed
all the advantages of a regular classical education.
And then Mr. Wingrove sauntered into the Club in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>his magnificent mannah, and then the floodgates opened.</p>

<p>“I’ve done it, Min.”</p>

<p>The great man was almost afraid the too-familiar
groundling would cast himself upon his neck.</p>

<p>“Done what, and why have you done it?” was the
unsympathetic inquiry of one whose heart was really
as ripe as his judgment.</p>

<p>A long and impassioned recital, of course; and Minnie
must help to make it a really great occasion, in order
to wipe the eye of No. 88, the corner house.</p>

<p>Mr. Wingrove evinced no particular enthusiasm for
this operation, and that was as it should have been,
because the attitude of Mr. Philip was fearfully unfilial.
Do not for a moment let us pretend it wasn’t.
But what was a chap to do?</p>

<p>In the circumstances, perhaps, thought Arminius Wingrove,
it would show good feeling to be married by the
Registrar.</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if we’ll be,” said Philip, “unless she
really wants it; and of course no girl does.”</p>

<p>“Then it appears to me,” said Arminius Wingrove,
“that you should go to church as quietly as possible in
the absence of your parents.”</p>

<p>“That’s their look-out, though,” said this dogged
Briton. “They’ll get an invitation; and if they like
to come, so much the better; and if they don’t, why it’s
up to us to show that we can do without ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>But Arminius Wingrove was quite a man of the world,
you know. If your admirable parents consent to grace
this celebration, said that great man, I will exert any
little influence I may possess to raise large type in
the Leading Morning Journal. But if your admirable
parents decide not to grace this celebration, let only
the chosen few be present, because to my mind good
taste requires it.</p>

<p>These were wise words of Arminius Wingrove. Pray
ponder ’em, you young bachelors of Cam and Isis. And
you young ladies of Newnham and Girton, should you
ever&mdash;which we hope you’ll never&mdash;go to church in a
mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of
your parents, please to remember that in the mature
judgment of the <i>arbiter elegantiarum</i>, good taste requires
that you shall be married in your traveling dress,
and that you shall go in by the side entrance.</p>

<span class="smaller">A GREAT OCCASION</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> was the first to see in the <i>Morning Post</i> that
a marriage had been arranged, and would shortly take
place. She handed the excellent journal across the
table to Father with a sphinxlike countenance. But,
as Mr. Jennings subsequently informed the housekeeper,
Mrs. Meeson, in a private colloquy in the pantry,
his lordship took the blow with resignation.</p>

<p>“No more than I’ve been expecting for some little
time past, Agatha,” said the great Proconsul.</p>

<p>But the wife of his bosom was dumb with dismay.</p>

<p>“Agatha,” said the Proconsul, after Mr. Jennings
had quitted the scene, “have you seen the Person?”</p>

<p>“I have, Wally; and I am strongly of opinion that
Philip is out of his mind.”</p>

<p>Not very comforting, was it?</p>

<p>There was only one thing to be done, though, and
that was what generations of excellent parents have had
to do before them&mdash;namely, and to wit, To Grin and
Bear It.</p>

<p>Frankly, the Governing Classes were not specially
good at grinning, but they bore the blow with resignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
tempered by quiet dignity. They had done nothing
to deserve the unmerited Cross of Fortune&mdash;the
Reverend Canon Fearon came in person to inform them
of that. Their lives were virtuous; their aspirations
blameless; their good works manifest. But the ways
of Providence were inscrutable&mdash;cream, please, but no
sugar, thank you&mdash;why the blow should have fallen
upon them of all people&mdash;a little brown bread and
butter&mdash;was one more familiar instance of the things
that passed all understanding.</p>

<p>Consolation for the spirit, you see, was at the service
of Mother. Father received that form of sustenance
also&mdash;at the Helicon, that temple of light.</p>

<p>“My dear Shelmerdine,” said Ch: Bungay, the
friend of his youth, “it is good to know that the blow
is sustained with the accustomed resignation of a true
Christian.”</p>

<p>It was by no means clear, however, that in Mount
Street the Christian Ticket was sweeping the polls at
this period. The resignation of Pa, in the opinion of
rumor, was a little less pronounced than that of his
neighbors. The butler gave notice the same afternoon.
On the following morning her ladyship’s maid declined
to stay to have her head bitten off, and went to the
length of saying so. Even the Reverend Canon Fearon
was constrained to think that an Irish peerage was
hardly the same as the home-made article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>It was an unlucky state of things, said the friends
of both families. Rather depended upon how you
looked at it though, thought the People Next Door.
A Love Match is sometimes superior to a <i>Mariage de
Convenance</i>, thought Ann Veronica, who had just returned
from Dresden. Perhaps She Won’t Be Quite
So Stuck Up Now, wrote the Flapper from Eastbourne.
He’s swopped her for the absolute nicest gal in London,
anyhow, said the Probationer in His Majesty’s
Horseguards. And Mamma said that she was surprised
that Percy should talk in that way; and his Papa hoped
that <i>he</i> wouldn’t go making a fool of himself; and the
Reverend Canon Fearon, when he called to ask the People
Next Door what they thought about it, was rather
inclined to agree with all parties, since yesterday at
luncheon his Bishop had given utterance to the profoundly
searching moral observation that the streams
of tendency were apt to overlook their banks a little
by the time the rising generation was ready to embark.</p>

<p>It is good to know that the Great did not lack spiritual
aid in their hour of tribulation. But Pa in Mount
Street and the Seventh Unmarried Daughter were not
so chastened as they might have been, perhaps; and
Father and Mother still went out to dinner regularly, in
spite of this humiliation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Father and Mother declined the invitation
to St. James’s, Wilton Place, and to the reception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>afterwards, which, if they would consent to grace it,
would be held by Grandmamma, her eighty-four years
notwithstanding, at the Hyde Park Hotel.</p>

<p>The reply of Mother was a model of dignity, but the
reception was not held. It could have been, certainly,
since there were a number of people who would have
been delighted to come; but the goddaughter of Bean,
in her conscious strength, agreed with Arminius Wingrove
that it would show good feeling not to wipe the
eye of Grosvenor Square.</p>

<p>The nuptials of Philip and Mary were not so brilliant
as they might have been, perhaps, had Father and
Mother attended them, but everything was very nice and
cheerful all the same. The bridesmaids were five ladies
of the Profession, including Marge; and excluding Timothy,
who was a page in an extraordinarily smart blue
suiting, which he had to be most careful how he sat in
it. It wasn’t Dr. Bridge who played the organ, but a
gentleman quite as clever, think some who heard him
on the festal afternoon. The ex-brother-officer remembered
where the ring was put; Philip remembered to
kiss Mary&mdash;and, you young bachelors of Cam and
Isis you will hurt Her feelings awfully if you should
forget that part of the ceremony, so kindly make a
note of the foregoing&mdash;and everybody thought the
Bride looked absolutely sweet, and that Philip was a
very fortunate young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>And in the judgment of Herb and Arminius Wingrove,
Grandmamma, in a fine new hat, was right in the
foreground of the picture.</p>

<p>Everything was just as it should have been; everybody
looked pleased and happy; and when forth the
organ pealed the noble work by Mendelssohn all agreed
that they made a mighty handsome pair.</p>

<p>There was no reception at the Hyde Park Hotel; but
Mr. Hollins bade all and sundry attend a tea-party on
the classic boards of Drury. Grandmamma cut the
cake that Mr. Hollins had provided; and Marge and
Timothy ate thereof&mdash;not a crumb more than was good
for ’em, although both came very near the limit. And
then Mr. Hollins made a speech which we feel obliged to
quote verbatim in this place.</p>

<p>Said Mr. Hollins: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I sincerely
hope this is not the end of a great career.
(Hear, hear.) I have my doubts about it, though. I
have seen this sort of thing before. (Cheers and laughter.)
We all envy the Bridegroom, and I am afraid
we shall find it hard to forgive him, if, as our prophetic
souls have feared, he robs a great profession of a
chief ornament. (Hear, hear.) But if this is a grudge
we may have to cherish against him, there is a service
he has rendered to us that must always redound
to his credit. He is the means of summoning back to
these classic boards, after an absence, she tells me, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>forty-three years, one of the great figures of a bygone
generation, whose name was as familiar as a household
word throughout the length and breadth of the land,
before even the improvident parents of the majority
of those of us who are present this afternoon had arranged
about our cradles. Ladies and Gentlemen, I
refer to that true ornament of her profession, Mrs.
Cathcart. (Loud and prolonged applause.) We are
exceedingly proud to have her among us; and some of
you will doubtless boast to your grandchildren that
you have had the opportunity of drinking the health
of this famous and venerable lady, because, after Sir
Herbert has proposed the health of the Bride, it is to
be my great privilege to propose that of one of the
truest ornaments the English stage has known.”
(Great enthusiasm.)</p>

<p>This was not all by any means that Mr. Hollins was
moved to say on this historic occasion. But you will
be able to gather, doubtless, from the general tenor of
the famous Manager’s remarks, that the Bride was quite
within her rights in being moved to tears, and that the
Bridegroom had warrant for the otherwise irrelevant
observation, “I wish the Mater had been here, old girl,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>And then in grim earnest the bowl began to flow; enthusiasm
began to wax parlous; and the wretched Bridegroom
had to get up on his hind legs, feeling quite as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>uncertain about the knee-joints as this unfortunate quadruped
of ours, and proceeded to apologize very sweetly
and humbly to the profession for having robbed it of
one of whom it had a right to be proud, and who was
a thousand and one times too good, at a conservative
estimate, for the chap who had brought her back from
St. James’s, Wilton Place. And candor forces us to admit
that this idle, rich young fellow, who had made a
good many enemies by his act of presumption, didn’t
materially add to their number by the speech which
he made, which, if not exactly that of an orator, was
yet manly and sincere and unaffected and no discredit
to the famous Twin Brethren who had nurtured his
youth.</p>

<span class="smaller">LOVE’S YOUNG DREAM</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first fortnight of the honeymoon was spent in
Paris. They looked at pictures and saw new plays,
and went racing on Sunday, and walked in the gardens
of Versailles, and did a hundred other cheerful things,
and were most marvelously happy. And Mary, who
hardly cared a bit about such matters, bought herself
a new hat.</p>

<p>They were tempted to go on to the Riviera, but duty
prevailed and they went to Brighton on the fourteenth
day. Grandmamma had gone to that famous physician
on her twenty-sixth annual excursion; and Mary felt
she must keep her eye upon her, for all that she was
such a hale and vigorous old thing.</p>

<p>Grandmamma was discovered in very nice lodgings
along the sea-front, in the care of a landlady, very civil
and voluble, and a mistress of the art of plain cooking.
Everything very pleasant and comfortable, and a sitting-room
with a balcony overlooking the King’s Parade.
It really seemed that the young couple might
put in a fortnight very profitably here, while their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>chosen residence in the metropolis was being painted
throughout.</p>

<p>They had their little adventures, of course, this happy
pair, because Brighthelmstone is the home of so many
romances. For one thing, they attracted attention
when they walked abroad. Philip was sure that it was
the hat from Paris; Mary was absolutely convinced
that it was the coat with the astrachan collar and the
spats by Grant and Cockburn. But what really impressed
the floating population of Brighthelmstone was
the comeliness of both; the simple pleasure they derived
from the society of each other; their abounding
joy in being allowed to walk about this underrated
planet.</p>

<p>Had this natural history of nothing in particular the
least pretensions to cynicism, which the world looks
for in a modern romance, the happy pair would be disillusioned
already. They should have been profoundly
weary of one another by the fourth day in Paris, according
to all the rules of the game. He should have
discovered that she was shallow and half-educated, and
consequently a bit of a bore when she brought the same
face downstairs three mornings consecutively for <i>café
au lait</i>. She should have discovered that he was selfish
and vain, and that in his heart he didn’t think that
Her belongings were equal to His, and that he saw
already what a fool he had made of himself. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>that being the case, she should have grown conscious
of her own inferiority, and begun to hate him because
she had done so, and wish herself back again on the
boards.</p>

<p>Moreover, had the Author really known his business,
they should have quarrelled bitterly on the subject of
Grandmamma. Who has heard of a newly-married
pair giving up the Riviera and going to Brighton to
look after an old lady of eighty-four with all her faculties?
He should have been obdurate, and she should
have shed tears of bitterness. He should have secretly
cursed his gods for the blindness that had shackled
him for the rest of his days; she should have had
thoughts of the Seine, and have given them expression.
He should have yielded when he should have stood firm;
she should have despised him for his weakness. They
should have snarled at one another all the way to
Brighton, and Grandmamma should have been very disagreeable
when they got there, and not in the least need
of their presence. But candor forces us to make full
confession of our incompetence. Because none of these
things came to pass.</p>

<p>Very much the contrary, let us assure you. Their
good looks and their air of general happiness were the
envy of all people of observation along the sea-front.
Still they had their adventures, and some at least
will have to be recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>One morning, as they proceeded almost arm-in-arm,
but not quite, looking as though they had just bought
the cosmos at five per cent. discount for cash, and were
completely satisfied with the transaction, they walked
right into a bath chair which was accompanied by a
Sealskin Coat and a Himalayan Dust Spaniel.</p>

<p>Salutations necessary, being right up against each
other, so to speak.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do, Adela,” said the Culprit, who in his
happiness seemed to have nothing to conceal and nothing
to defend. “You know my wife, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The wind was certainly blowing very chilly from the
northern heights this morning. ’Tis a little way it has
in March at Brighthelmstone.</p>

<p>Pa was not so bad as he might have been.</p>

<p>“Introdooce me,” said His Britannic Majesty’s former
Ambassador to Persia.</p>

<p>So Pa was introduced to the Bride; and she afterwards
told Hubby that he was like any other Pa, only
a little more so. And, she being a girl of sense as
well as of spirit, Pa didn’t seem to mind talking to her
a little, particularly as she knew so much about rheumatism,
because it was Granny’s complaint.</p>

<p>Had Lord Warlock tried the new treatment?</p>

<p>No; what was that?</p>

<p>The new treatment called for explanation. Duly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>forthcoming with minuteness and lucidity. No; not a
designing minx, mesdames, altogether. Tact, certainly;
but it had its roots, remember, in a heart as
sound as a bell, overflowing with practical sympathy
for all the world and his wife.</p>

<p>“Grandmamma has a book about it, and a special apparatus.
It has done her a power of good&mdash;a power of
good. She will be delighted to lend them, I’m sure&mdash;that’s
if you care, Lord Warlock. It’s a wonderful invention,
and I’ll bring it round this afternoon, and show
you how it works.”</p>

<p>“Thank yah,” said the Ex-Ambassador to Persia.
“And I’ll be devilish obliged.”</p>

<p>Hubby, though, was not doing quite so well with the
Sealskin Coat. Brighthelmstone so dull and tiresome,
so cold, and hotels so unpleasant; and all the time the
fair speaker announced these drawbacks she looked not
so much at the young man who ought to have married
her, but out of the corner of a cold blue eye at the person
who was talking to Pa as though she knew all about
his complaint.</p>

<p>“Thank yah,” said Pa, touching his hat, one of those
hard, square felt ones whose ugliness nought can surpass,
as the procession passed on. “The Suffolk.
Don’t forget.”</p>

<p>A designing minx&mdash;madam, we do not agree. Mere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>tact, you know. And it was perfectly clear that her
quick, spontaneous, practical sympathy had left its
mark even on that unpromising subject.</p>

<p>Not such a fool as I thought he was not to have
taken this gal off my hands, reflected the Uncompromising
Subject within the precincts of his bath chair.
And then, with the air of one who nurses an injury,
he proceeded to inquire of the Seventh Unmarried
Daughter&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, Addie my gal, what do you think of the
Mésalliance?”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t profess to be a judge of chorus girls,”
said the rude girl, jerking the unfortunate Himalayan
Dust Spaniel right off his feet.</p>

<p>Actually rude to her Pa, you see. Really, miss!
But are you quite doing her Justice, young friend?
says Mr. G-ls-w-thy. Do you think the girl has had
fair play? because, frankly, I don’t. Born with a silver
spoon in her mouth; every whim gratified; never
had a soul to cross or deny her; always able to go to
the Stores and order what she wanted within reason;
never rubbed her shoulders against life in its sterner aspects
like your more fortunate heroine; never changed
an iota since she used to bully her nurse. Fact is,
young friend, says Mr. G-lsw-thy, you can’t expect
people who have had a plumb wicket to bat on all their
born days to play as well as those who have been well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>schooled on more difficult pitches. Mind, I don’t say
that Adela would ever have been as nice as your Mary,
but I feel very strongly that under fairer conditions
there is a great deal of good in the girl that must have
reached the surface.</p>

<p>Her manner would always have been a bit against
her, of course, Pa not being over-rich for his position;
the eye would always have been a little contemptuous,
since it was its nature to; but there were certain things
in the girl that a hard, uphill, unprotected life in the
great textile towns of England, Scotland, Ireland and
Wales, a trip to Australia and South Africa, and a six
months’ tour in the United States and Canada might
have developed considerably. But, concludes the Sage,
it would have remained a nice question whether she
would have been as well fitted to be a Mayfair hostess,
or to arrange a shooting party, or to ride in Leicestershire,
or to attend the gracious Consort of our Sovereign,
as she is at present.</p>

<p>These alternatives are of a character that we are not
competent to express an opinion upon; but, at present,
Mr. Philip seemed to be in no doubt as to the wisdom
of his choice; and really that seems rather important,
particularly as the young fellow overflowed with happiness
as he walked along the King’s Parade, longing to
take the arm of the nicest girl in Brighthelmstone into
his keeping, and yet fearing to do so since it was rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>advertising the fact that they had only been married a
fortnight.</p>

<p>“I say, kidlet”&mdash;overpass the epithet, you Old Married
People; you know you have once been as guilty
yourselves&mdash;“you talked like a book to the Belted One,
didn’t you, what?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Phil-ipp, the poor old dear. The same complaint
as Granny. I’m going to take him her apparatus
and show him how to work it, and I’ve guaranteed
that he will be able to walk upstairs after he has
used it a week.”</p>

<p>“Have you, though? But how you dared, I’m blest
if I know.”</p>

<p>“Cow-yard, Phil-ipp. He’s rather a dear, really.”</p>

<p>“A most disagreeable old gentleman, and the worst
manners of any Privy Councillor in London.”</p>

<p>“A libel, Phil-ipp. I’m sure he’s not so bad as
all that. Anyhow, if he is, I shall try and reform
him.”</p>

<span class="smaller">ADVENTURES RARE AND STRANGE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was opposite the Magnificent that they came upon
adventure the second. Two gentlemen of somewhat informal
aspect, one of whom was in need of a shave, and
both of whose hats were light green, greeted Mary as
if they were half afraid to do so, and yet didn’t like to
pass her by.</p>

<p>“Thought perhaps you mightn’t remember us,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Remember <i>you</i>, Horace! Could I ever forget you?
And why, I declare it’s Johnny?”</p>

<p>And Mary shook hands with Horace and Johnny so
simply and so cordially&mdash;for all that she had married
a Toff&mdash;that they were obliged to confess that they
were quite sure she couldn’t.</p>

<p>The next moment Horace and Johnny were being
introduced to the Toff; with rather a display of wariness
on their part, because provincial stars who have
had to carve out their own destiny have not much use
for the Breed, and they owed him a grudge as well for
having robbed the profession of an idol. So when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>Toff held out his hand and appeared pleased to meet
them, it was not so certain that they were pleased to
meet him.</p>

<p>“Horace Allwright, Philip, the very first Pickles I
ever played to&mdash;and the best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go hon, John Willie,” said the Star of the
North, blushing to the roots of his hair, which was red
and, therefore, made his pleasure the more conspicuous.
But he wasn’t going to stand any swank from Eton
and Ch: Ch:; and the rather fierce eye of this fine natural
comedian said so pretty distinctly.</p>

<p>Mary was undefeated, though, and Johnny Dubosque
not being so great a man as Horace Allwright, and
consequently having less in the way of dignity to look
after, was soon behaving as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“But I expect you’ll never come to the provinces
again, Polly,” said Johnny Dubosque sadly. “I said
to Horace it was all up with <i>us</i> as soon as you got to
the Lane. But you’ll be turning up the perfession altogether
now.”</p>

<p>Mary said it might be so, and Johnny Dubosque
sighed deeply, and informed the Toff in a burst of confidence
that her place could never be filled. And the
Toff&mdash;for all that the Twin Brethren were not a little
discomposed by hearing one who was not a fellow
alumnus speak of the wife as Polly&mdash;apologized so
nicely to the Perfession for having done what it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>done, that Johnny Dubosque, who had a generous heart,
felt not a little inclined to forgive him, and Horace
Allwright somewhat waived the question of his dignity.</p>

<p>“Come across to the Magnificent, old chap, and ’ave
a drink,” said Horace Allwright in a sudden and overwhelming
burst of hospitality.</p>

<p>The Toff accepted the invitation, and for that act
of grace, my lords and gentlemen, honor is due to the
Twin Brethren, who as <i>you</i> do not require to be told,
would have disbursed current coin of the realm to shirk
this obvious duty. But it would never do to make an
enemy of a friend of Mary’s. Therefore the Twin
Brethren allowed themselves to be led across the road
about as cheerfully as a lamb is led to the slaughter;
and the grandees of the place stared very hard at the
entrance of These Theatrical People; and the Twin
Brethren devoutly hoped that no stray member of the
Button Club was lying concealed among the ferns.</p>

<p>Modest libations were ordered by Mr. Horace Allwright
in a rather loud manner, with a lemon squash
for Mary, although this was mere natural politeness on
her part.</p>

<p>“We shall not see her equal as Cinderella, not in our
time, my lord,” said Mr. Horace Allwright in a very
audible aside to the Toff, in order to keep in touch with
the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Of course you will, Horace, and many a better
one,” said the Uncrowned Queen of Blackhampton, having
with her ready tact and her quick observation detected
the plight of the unhappy Twin Brethren who
were blenching a little under their tan.</p>

<p>Not so far off were a pair of Contemporaries, out of
sight, perchance, yet by no means out of hearing.</p>

<p>“Why, if it isn’t that damned fool Shel, with his
mésalliance!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;my God!”</p>

<p>“Rather nice, though, in spite of the friends of the
family.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and pull the leg of the silly old fool, and
make him turn out for us to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Contemporaries rose from their table,
very finely grown young men and superbly tailored, as
all distinguished athletes should be.</p>

<p>“Why, Shel, old man, how are you?”</p>

<p>Hearty hand-grips were exchanged, although the
Twin Brethren were not feeling so very robust at present.</p>

<p>“Fancy meeting you here!”</p>

<p>There was no particular reason why they shouldn’t
meet there, but it is always a useful opening card. And
then the Olympians were introduced to Mary, and pretty
keenly did they scrutinize her, although they pretended
so well that they were doing nothing of the sort that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>would have taken a woman to have told what the sly
dogs were at.</p>

<p>And then Miss Mary trod very hard on the foot of
Eton and Ch: Ch:, which begged pardon humbly and
introduced Mr. Horace Allwright and Mr. Johnny Dubosque,
and piously hoped to its Maker that it hadn’t
got mixed in their names.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you, gentlemen,” said Mr. Horace
Allwright spaciously. “’Ave a drink.”</p>

<p>The Olympians had had a drink already, but they
had no objection to having another; and this accommodating
disposition caused Mary to take them into
favor at once, and they were invited to sit down.</p>

<p>“’Ere’s a health to the bride,” said Mr. Johnny
Dubosque.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“I was just a-tellin’ his lordship,” said Mr. Horace
Allwright, “that she was absolutely the finest Cinderella
I’ve ever played to, and I’ve played to some of the
first in my time, let me tell you. Good ’ealth, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>And while Mr. Horace Allwright was happily engaged
in pledging the health of the company, Mary
proceeded to transfix the first Olympian with such a
staunch, straight and demure gray eye that the heart
of the famous athlete was literally pinned against the
antimacassar of yellow plush upholstery which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>been provided by the hotel for the use of its patrons.</p>

<p>“His lordship’s drawn a winner in the lottery, gentlemen,”
continued Mr. Horace Allwright, and in this the
first Olympian was strongly inclined to concur.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Horace,” said the Uncrowned Queen of
Blackhampton with a very arch glance at Johnny Dubosque.
“It isn’t cricket, is it, Johnny? in these fashionable
watering-places. And I won’t have you pull
the leg of my Phil-ipp by calling him my lord, when
he’s promised me solemn to stand for Mr. Lloyd
George.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t, Shel?” quoth the Olympians, feeling
it was up to them to say something, and that this was
something they might say.</p>

<p>“Oh, but he has,” said the Uncrowned Queen, “and
I should never have married him if he hadn’t&mdash;should I,
Phil-ipp?”</p>

<p>And she transfixed both the Olympians this time with
that demure glance of tremendous impact.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say, Mrs. Shel,” quoth the first Olympian,
beginning to feel a glow within, “what about his Governor,
you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about his Governor, Mr. Wilbraham,
because I’m not received in the Family at present.”</p>

<p>And this time the glance came right home to the
Twin Brethren, who at once began to feel like bucking
up a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“But you are bound to be, Mrs. Shel, aren’t you?”
said Mr. Wilbraham with great Tact.</p>

<p>“Why am I bound to be?” inquired the Uncrowned
Queen, whose good gray eye had begun to play the
dickens with the second Olympian.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, you know. Isn’t she, Toddles?”</p>

<p>Toddles was strongly of opinion that she was.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if you both really think that&mdash;”</p>

<p>But in the secret recesses of his nature, Toddles was
even more strongly of opinion that if she persisted in
looking at him in that way he would be bound to kiss
her.</p>

<p>“Are you and Mr. Wilbraham any good at snooker?
Yes, I can see it in your eyes. Well, Phil-ipp and
Johnny and I will play the three of you for a sovereign.”</p>

<p>“Done with you, Mrs. Shel,” said the Olympians
with promptitude.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Shelmerdine looked very demurely
at Horace Allwright, and imposed the condition that
the stakes should be deposited with the marker, as her
success in life was entirely due to the fact that she
never trusted on principle a man who came from Leeds.</p>

<p>“But I come from Leeds myself,” said Toddles, who,
of course, was none other than the popular Yorkshire
cricketer when he had time to spare for the game.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; why not? But how could you tell I came from
Leeds, Mrs. Shelmerdine?”</p>

<p>“By your trousers.”</p>

<p>Horace and Johnny roared long and loud at this
brilliant sally. The natural insight of those famous
comedians had taught them already that if Toddles had
a weakness, it was an undue pride in his trousers, which
of course the young man was quite entitled to have,
since they were the work of Mr. F-ster of London and
Oxford.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t let her pull your leg, old man,” said
Philip, who, as usual a little behind in the uptake, had
only just begun his roar. “She’ll rag the life out of
you if you’ll let her.”</p>

<p>Without further preface or apology, an adjournment
was made to the billiard saloon, which was down a very
long corridor. <i>En route</i>, Mr. Wilbraham, whose name
in athletic circles was Weary William, because he was
never in a hurry, confided to Toddles that she was every
bit as nice off the stage as she was on it.</p>

<p>To which Toddles, in whose cognomen a meaning has
yet to be discovered, rejoined that “He was always a
far-seein’ old swine.”</p>

<p>Mary liked a light cue, and used it in a manner which
did not suggest the novice. By what means she had
gained her skill, it would be best, perhaps, not to inquire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
At least, it is hardly likely that Grandma had
taught her.</p>

<p>The Olympians also had misspent their youth a little,
and Horace Allwright’s father had been a billiard-marker,
so it was quite as well, perhaps, that Mary was
so skillful, and that Philip was able to say he was a
pupil of Mr. John Roberts, Junior. The master might
not have been very proud of him, though, to judge by
the way he started; but he improved as the game went
on, and as Johnny Dubosque knew Stevenson to talk
to, the game was quite worth looking at in the opinion
of a somewhat saturnine-looking gentleman who sat in
the corner drinking Schweppe’s ginger ale, and picking
winners out of the <i>Sportsman</i>.</p>

<p>The game was twenty-nine all, and there was only one
ball left on the table, and that was “a sitter” on the
brink of the left-hand top pocket, which Mary, who
had played amazingly well all through, had left there
to her unfeigned sorrow. It was all over, bar the
shouting, when Toddles proceeded to deliver his cue,
for it really was a shot that one who had used his youth
as he had done ought not to have missed with his eyes
shut.</p>

<p>In the most unaccountable manner the famous center
forward missed the shot with his eyes wide open,
promptly apostrophized his Maker, and insisted in paying
the stakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“You did that a-purpose, Mr. Toddles,” said Mary
sternly, “and I scorn to take your money. I am not
a suffragist yet, but that’s the kind of thing to make
me one. Why, a woman can’t even have fair play at a
game like snooker.”</p>

<p>Followed a heated controversy. Mr. Toddles would
not confess to his guilt, which was really so flagrant
that Mary wondered how he dared deny the charge.
Horace Allwright and Weary William lied circumstantially
to support the misdemeanant, but Mary refused
to accept the stakes, and in this we venture to think she
was right.</p>

<p>No, Toddles, young friend, it is not the way to produce
a race of sportswomen. Your intentions were of
the highest, certainly, but your charming opponent had
taken such degrees in the school of experience, although
she was hardly twenty-four at present, that she didn’t
even think it polite.</p>

<p>There was only one method of composing the quarrel,
and that was to play the match over again. And this
time, it is sad to relate of three excellent sportsmen,
good care was taken that there should be no doubt whatever
about the issue.</p>

<p>“And now you have taken us on at this game, Shel,”
said the first Olympian, “we shall expect you to turn
out for us to-morrow against Brighton and Hove Albion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“But I haven’t kicked a ball for years.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for you. The match is for
the benefit of the widow and young children of a good
chap, and you were always a great draw for the public.”</p>

<p>“Was I?” said Mr. Philip apprehensively, for he
read in the eyes of Mary that his doom was sealed.</p>

<p>“Were you, Phil-ipp! Might never have kicked
three goals against Scotland, mightn’t you? Why, of
course you’ll play; especially as it’s a benefit match.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t kicked a ball for years and years, and
I’ve got no gear either.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon fix you up with some gear, won’t we,
Mrs. Shel?” said the exultant Olympians.</p>

<p>“Ra-<i>ther</i>.”</p>

<p>Poor Philip protested bitterly; but he knew, alas!
that he would have to bow to the inevitable. At a quarter-past
three on the morrow, after an absence of four
years, he was doomed to reappear in the ranks of the
famous amateur team whom he had helped to make history.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH PHILIP RENEWS HIS YOUTH</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Horace and Johnny resumed their walk along
the King’s Parade, they felt at least two inches taller
for having rubbed shoulders with the aristocracy.
Everybody does, Sir, says Mr. Thackeray; and no one
is a penny the worse for this national feeling, we venture
to hope, provided it is not carried to excess. Certainly
the girls of Brighthelmstone had a rare treat for
the rest of the day, Johnny and Horace putting on wonderful
“side,” and setting their hats at an angle warranted
to kill at sight.</p>

<p>The Idol of the Profession ought never to have married
a Toff. Still, they all did it if they had the chance,
so you could hardly blame her. But the great thing
was, she hadn’t changed at all. She was just the same
honest pal as when she played at the Queen’s at Leeds.
Her heart was still in the right place in spite of her
elevation. It wasn’t always so, but it was in this case.
She was one of the very best, and she had proved it that
morning to five places of decimals recurring, by not
being ashamed of old friends.</p>

<p>Thus you see, my lords and gentlemen, in spite of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>the fact that Horace and Johnny swaggered along the
King’s Parade in a way that Eton and Oxford never
do&mdash;do they?&mdash;and that <i>you</i> would hardly have cared
to accept their invitation to cross the road and ’ave a
drink at the good old Magnificent&mdash;at least, not when
the wife was with you&mdash;they were really modest men at
heart, as most men are if they ever attain to reasonable
eminence in their particular walk of life.</p>

<p>“Fancy <i>you</i> marrying a Toff!” Horace Allwright
had whispered to Mary over his beer.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t one, pray?” was the rejoinder of the
future Lady Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth.</p>

<p>“You are right&mdash;why not?” said Horace. “Because,
after all, you are a Toff yourself.”</p>

<p>And in the middle of the King’s Parade the famous
comedian reaffirmed the conviction.</p>

<p>“And he’s not a bad chap either, considerin’,” said
Horace. “Damn good snooker, anyhow, and the best
inside right that ever kicked a ball, except Steve
Bloomer, and we’ll go and see him play to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> think?” said Johnny Dubosque expansively,
laying siege to a nursemaid&mdash;and a pretty
one, too, in a very smart bonnet.</p>

<p>This is all quite trivial and doesn’t really help the
narrative, but the point we wish to make is, that our
friend Philip had not exactly wasted his morning, whatever
may be the views of parents and guardians upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>the subject. This idle, rich young man, instead of
alienating sympathy for his class, had added two recruits
to the chosen band of its friends and admirers.
He had behaved very well in difficult circumstances,
and he had now two more friends spread over the world
than he had started out with in life. Consequently he
had increased the public stock of human amenity, and we
venture, therefore, to think that his morning had been
very far from wasted.</p>

<p>Mary also had done very well, having brought Mr.
Philip out of his shell a bit. Quite an eventful morning;
nothing to what the following afternoon would be,
though, when he had to play <i>v</i> Brighton and Hove Albion
for the benefit of the widow and young family of
the late Joe McPherson. After the match at snooker,
Philip was borne off in triumph to Brighthelmstone’s
leading sports emporium to find a white flannel shirt
about his size and a pair of dark-blue knickerbockers,
and a very smart pair of stockings, and some shin-guards,
and, most important of all, a pair of boots that
would fit him.</p>

<p>The morrow would be a great ordeal, particularly in
a bran-new pair of boots, for a chap who had not
kicked a ball for four years, but Mary was adamant,
and the Olympians, too. A benefit match; a great
draw for the public; do him all the good in the world.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have some special bills printed,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>Toddles with something suspiciously like a wink at the
future Lady Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, for God’s sake!”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have given it away, Mr. Toddles,”
expostulated Mary.</p>

<p>“You won’t half get a licking to-morrow,” said the
shop boy with broad satisfaction as he tied up the
parcel. “The Albion’s playing its full league team.”</p>

<p>“But the Olympians are playing the team that won
the Arthur Dunn Cup,” said the future Lady Shelmerdine
of Potterhanworth, with something suspiciously
like a wink at Toddles, “and if you’ve any sense, boy&mdash;and
you ought to have lots with that high forehead&mdash;you
won’t put your weekly sixpence on the Albion to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Great things were promised for the morrow, but Mary
put in some more useful work that afternoon. About
four o’clock she carried round Granny’s apparatus, together
with the book of the words, to Pa at the Suffolk.
She was received by His Britannic Majesty’s Ex-Ambassador
to Persia; had the honor of drinking tea
with him; discussed rheumatism in general; showed the
working of the apparatus, and even demonstrated it, not
without symptoms of success; and in less than half an
hour had made such an incursion upon the regard of
this widower of ripe experience, that he was fain to
inform the seventh unmarried daughter over dinner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>“that young Shelmerdine’s wife was a devilish sensible
woman, and he hoped to see more of her.”</p>

<p>Tact; natural goodness of heart; a sunny temper, and
a practical disposition; these be great qualities, you
young ladies of Newnham and Girton. The widower
of ripe experience was a mighty shrewd judge of your
kind, although a severe one, because he had not chosen
so wisely as he might have done in the First Instance;
and in the Second Instance, had he chosen less wisely
he might have been more comfortable; but he knew a
good, sensible, sound-hearted young woman when he
saw one, and he knew quite enough of her importance
to the world not to undervalue her. Hence the “chorus
girl” had already made a considerable incursion&mdash;and
the pearl necklace and the simple black dinner-frock
which had cost a hundred guineas, and the hair <i>très
bien coiffés</i> were a little cooler to Pa than usual, and
nibbled more salted almonds than was good for ’em.</p>

<p>The apparatus could do Pa no harm; Mr. Joseph
O’Flatherty, his lordship’s valet, was strongly of that
opinion, and said so to her ladyship’s maid, whose name
was Adèle, but had been changed to Lisette for obvious
reasons. Whether the apparatus actually brought material
benefit to Pa, we are not in a position to state
positively; but there can be no doubt that, indirectly,
the apparatus had a tonic effect upon Pa’s general system.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>
<p>The day of the match had now arrived, and that
was such an important affair, being for the benefit of
the widow and five young children of the late Joe McPherson,
as honest a player as ever handled the ball
when the referee wasn’t looking, that it will be necessary
to supply some sort of an account of this historic
function.</p>

<p>It was a crowded and glorious day for Mary and
Philip; and it really started pretty soon after breakfast,
when those famous men, namely and to wit, Toddles
and W. W., rang the bell of Granny’s lodgings
and were ushered into the front sitting-room on the first
floor. At the moment of their arrival Mary was trying
over on the piano, which had several of its notes intact,
although none of them in tune, the latest manifestation
of the genius of Mr. Rubens.</p>

<p>“Please, don’t let us interrupt you,” said W. W.,
laying a suspicious-looking brown paper parcel on the
table.</p>

<p>Mary, however, took this for mere natural politeness.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve brought them, I see. <i>Do</i> let me
look.”</p>

<p>Now what was it, do you suppose, that she wanted to
look at? Wait, if you please, until W. W. has cut
the string of the parcel with a pocketknife that was
given him by his Aunt Marian, contrary to the advice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>of his parents, about the time he wore his H. M. S. <i>Indomitable</i>.</p>

<p>Five hundred handbills were in the parcel, printed
by the Brighthelmstone Steam Printing Company, Ltd.
Mary seized eagerly the one that was solemnly presented
to her by W. W., while Toddles, more demonstrative
than he, grinned effusively from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Mary read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2 center no-indent">GRAND FOOTBALL MATCH FOR THE BENEFIT<br />
OF THE WIDOW AND FIVE CHILDREN<br />
OF THE LATE JOE McPHERSON.<br /><br />

The Olympians <i>v</i> Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>

<p class="p2 center no-indent">The Honorable Philip Shelmerdine has arrived in<br />
Brighton, and will positively reappear at inside<br />
right this afternoon at 3:15.</p></div>

<p class="p2">“I think that will about fix it, Mrs. Shel,” said W.
W. proudly. “We’ll have these distributed all over the
place; and we’ve got some bigger ones, too, to go on
the hoardings.”</p>

<p>But Philip, who at that moment was taking his fox
terrier for a short constitutional, had seen the hoardings
already. Thus, when he came in about five minutes
later, bloodshed nearly ensued. A feeble jest, undoubtedly,
but one of the penalties of athletic greatness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>And when Mary insisted upon distributing with her own
gloved hands these handbills to every passer-by along
the King’s Parade, they came within hail of their first
quarrel. To be sure, the majority of the recipients
thought they were Votes for Women, and didn’t look
at them, and those who did look at them treated them
as of no importance, so it really didn’t matter; but poor
Philip was made quite miserable&mdash;that is, almost miserable,
since it was no longer possible for him to achieve
that condition&mdash;and felt that it was really too bad
of her to pull his leg in that way, for he was quite sure
that she was the authoress of the plot.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was. Still, the jest was very feeble and
harmless, and only modesty in its most exaggerated
form could have been wounded by it. Not a soul in
Brighthelmstone took the announcement of the Honorable
Philip Shelmerdine’s arrival and positive reappearance
that afternoon at all seriously.</p>

<p>But stay! In our chivalrous desire to excuse the
Heroine, perhaps this statement is a little too general.
There was one person, and just one person only, in
Brighthelmstone who treated the handbill as a thing of
consequence.</p>

<p>Mary, distributing her handbills along the King’s
Parade, assisted by her two companions in guilt and at
least four other Olympians who had been specially
coöpted for the purpose, while Philip, with his hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>in his pockets, was trying to look supremely unconscious
of the fact that his leg was being pulled frightfully,
came upon a Bath Chair, a Sealskin Coat and a
Himalayan Dust Spaniel.</p>

<p>“Are you feeling any <i>benefit</i> this morning, Lord
Warlock? And please let me give you one of these.
And you, Lady Adela, must take one, please. It is <i>so</i>
important.”</p>

<p>“Thank yah,” said His Britannic Majesty’s Ex-Ambassador
to Persia. “If it’s votes for women, I think
they oughtn’t to have ’em, although, mind you&mdash;benefit
for the widow and five children of the late Joe McPherson&mdash;very
praiseworthy object&mdash;shall be happy to
subscribe a sovereign.”</p>

<p>The Sealskin Coat, however, did not appear to look
at the object in that Christian light. Having perused
the handbill with an eye of cold disdain, Adela folded
up the handbill neatly, and, without making any observation
upon the merits of the case, placed it in her muff.
But as soon as she returned to the Suffolk, she addressed
an envelope to the Lady Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth,
88 Grosvenor Square, London, W., and therein enclosed,
anonymously, of course, the announcement of the Honorable
Philip’s arrival and reappearance. A rather
feeble thing to have done really, and hardly worthy of
mention, except that it shows what human nature can
achieve in a moment of reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Philip was greeted effusively by the rest of his brothers
in arms, who had now arrived at the Magnificent;
and the Bride was introduced to them all. The report
of her charms had been carried to them by Toddles and
W. W., who were sealed of the tribe of her admirers
already. And it had been agreed by the whole team
that if she never did anything else, the fact that she
had caused the finest inside right save one in the country
to return to this important position after a lapse of
four years, must ever count to her for grace.</p>

<p>Poor Philip was in a rather nervous state when he
drove on to the ground in a brake with his ten companions
and with Mary on the box-seat. That enterprising
young woman had already elected herself to the
important position of commander-in-chief of the famous
team of amateurs, which contained no less than nine
International players. But even this achievement was
not exactly the fruit of self-assertion. She was one
of those gifted people who instinctively, yet quite pleasantly
and unobtrusively, take charge of everything and
everybody. Already <i>persona gratissima</i> at the Suffolk;
already saluted by the most dignified constables in
Brighton; on terms of intimacy with the master of the
longest pier&mdash;she had taken the Olympians under her
wing in the most comprehensive manner.</p>

<p>The spectators came in their thousands because it
was Saturday afternoon and the Albion were announced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>to play their full League team; and the Olympians with
their nine International players were ever a great attraction.
But the start was delayed ten minutes, and a
great concourse was kept waiting because Mary had
brought her kodak. She took charge of the Albion as
well as their opponents; posing them for the camera,
and appearing to know each of them by name, although
she didn’t really; but it was all done with the charm and
the naïve assurance that had made her so famous with
the public.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, ma’am,” said the Secretary and Manager;
“don’t like to hurry you, but the crowd is getting
a bit restive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell the band to play ‘Rule Britannia,’ and it
will be all right,” said Mary.</p>

<p>And in this her judgment was perfectly sound.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, look your best,” said she. “All smile,
please. Just imagine you have knocked out the Villa,
which, of course, you will next Saturday, because I’ve
made up my mind that you are going to, and I’m a
proper mascot, as they know in the North. Not too
broad, Joe Pierce, because of the plate. Ve-ry nice&mdash;ve-ry
nice in-deed. Thank you, boys; and just see if
you don’t beat the Villa, although, of course, you are
going to lose this afternoon.”</p>

<p>So much for her handling of the democracy, which
was brilliantly successful. The whole team were her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>humble servants to command, now that she had exercised
her powers upon them. Her handling of the aristocracy&mdash;not
that these idle class distinctions obtain
upon the field of play&mdash;was equally happy. She was
entirely responsible for the fact that the game began
seventeen minutes late, but nobody seemed to mind particularly,
“Rule Britannia” having been twice repeated.</p>

<p>A very good game it was, and a keenly critical crowd
was vastly entertained. The famous inside right had
not been forgotten, although the public memory is
short as a rule. At first, in his new boots, he had,
like a certain Biblical hero, to walk delicately; but he
soon began to improve, and presently got on better than
he had expected. Although he had not played football
for four years, he was in fairly hard condition, as
he took pretty regular exercise of one sort or another.
Still, the pace was so hot at first that he felt it would
be bound to kill him. But when at last he had got his
second wind, and beautiful slow-stealing passes began
to come his way from the famous center forward with
whom he had shared many a triumph, the old magic
seemed somehow to return, he began to enjoy the proceedings
thoroughly, and so did the spectators.</p>

<p>The Albion scored a good goal quite early in the
game, but just before half-time the center forward made
the scores equal. Then the band played again; collecting-boxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
were sent round the ground for the benefit of
the widow and young family of the late Joe McPherson;
and Mary herself took charge of one of them, and,
of course, her box got twice as much as anybody else’s,
which was bound to be the case, since she looked so
charming, and her way with the great British Public
was very charming also.</p>

<p>Who was the lady wearing the ribbon of the Olympians,
who was getting sixpences and shillings for her
box, while the others had to be content with pence for
the most part? Who was the lady with that wonderful
way with her, whose handsome face&mdash;and it really did
look handsome just now, for all that it was so square
and sensible&mdash;was so familiar on picture-postcards and

<p>The famous Miss Caspar from Drury Lane. No
wonder her manner was so captivating. No wonder it
was so pleasantly sure of itself, when all London had
been times and again to watch her put on the Prince’s
slipper, and the Honorable P. Shelmerdine, the son of
a lord and in his day a very fine player, and doing very
well this afternoon, had been lucky enough to marry
her.</p>

<p>Yes, the lady with the collecting-box was undoubtedly
lending rare distinction to the proceedings. Sixpences
and shillings and even half-crowns were raining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>into her box from the reserved enclosure. The widow
and young family of the late Joe McPherson would, undoubtedly,
gain very substantially from her efforts, as
other deserving objects had done in the past and were
likely to do in the future.</p>

<p>The rakish green hats of Horace and Johnny were
well to the fore, and the fact that Mary couldn’t possibly
miss them cost their owners half-a-crown apiece.
And Horace Allwright, as he proudly disbursed this
sum, remembered that in the near future a benefit performance
was going to be given at the Royal Italian
Opera House, Blackhampton, for one who had served
the public long and faithfully, but who now had fallen
upon evil days.</p>

<p>“I say, Mary, old girl,” said Horace, “that reminds
me, we are giving a complimentary matinée at Blackhampton
on Tuesday week for poor old Harry Merino&mdash;you
remember poor old Harry&mdash;and you are such
a great power in Blackhampton that I thought perhaps&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said Mary. “Half-a-crown,
please, Horace. Yes, of course, put me down for ‘Arcadee’
and ‘Nelson’ and&mdash;now, do I ever forget?”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, old girl,” said Horace Allwright
humbly, and Johnny Dubosque echoed him.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. And don’t say another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>word to the man at the wheel, because we are losing
money. Thank you, sir, so much. A <i>very</i> good cause&mdash;poor
old Joe was one of the best.”</p>

<p>How she knew that poor old Joe was one of the best
it would be difficult to say. But, at least, she seemed
able to convince the reserved enclosure that the case
of Joe’s widow and family was worthy of their charity,
for when she delivered her box into the care of the secretary
and manager soon after the game had re-started,
that gentleman was astonished at the amount of money
there was in it; moreover, he rubbed his hands with satisfaction,
and paid a sincere and richly merited compliment
to the celebrated lady from the Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip in his new boots struggled manfully
through the second half of the game, although there
was precious little skin left on his toes by this time;
and he wondered how he was going to live to the end,
since there didn’t seem to be a breath left in him. But
something of the old magic had come back. If he could
only kick a goal for his side, he would feel that his life
had not been lived in vain.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, this desire was gratified. Still,
this may not be altogether surprising, having regard
to the fact that every movement of those mutilated toes
engaged the sympathetic interest of a mascot mighty
in the North, and in the South also, if it came to that.
There were only about ten minutes to play; the score
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>was still one all, when another of those beautiful slow-stealing
passes came from the center forward, and
Philip, knowing that it was now or never, drew the bow
at a venture in the inspired way he did in his prime.
And somehow he happened to time his effort at the
psychological instant,&mdash;just as a stalwart son of
Caledonia knocked him right into the middle of next
week.</p>

<p>That is how the Albion came to lose the match.
Yet the result didn’t matter really; very spirited and
skillful play had been shown by both sides, there was
nothing at stake, and a good cause had prospered.
But Philip was the proudest and happiest man in
Brighthelmstone as he staggered to the dressing-room
with his poor feet, and knowing full well that he would
hardly be able to walk for a fortnight.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN WHICH GRANDMAMMA RENEWS HERS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Philip and Mary returned to the King’s
Parade with their inmost thoughts centered upon a
dish of tea, a great surprise awaited them. The sitting-room
overlooking the sea was in the occupation
of no less a person than His Britannic Majesty’s Ex-Ambassador
to Persia. He had come, it appeared, to
thank Grandmamma personally for the loan of her apparatus,
and to commemorate the amount of good it
had already done the complaint from which they suffered
in common.</p>

<p>It happened that Grandmamma, like other old ladies
who have moved in the world, could talk to a lord as
well as most people if she happened to be in the humor.
Well, she had had a pretty good nap; the cap-with-the-Siddons’-lace
was as straight as you please; and
she had a distinct recollection of having met the Ex-Ambassador
at Knebworth somewhere about the year
1881.</p>

<p>Long before Philip, accompanied by Mary, returned
in his unconventional footballing costume, these two interesting
persons were getting on like a house on fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>The past was reconstructed and repeopled; the present
was deplored, and, alas! abused not a little. Mrs.
Cathcart had known Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Disraeli&mdash;whom
she couldn’t abide!&mdash;Mr. Dickens, Mr. Thackeray,
Lord Tennyson, Mr. Bright, and Garibaldi.
Comparisons are invidious, but where are the persons
of that type nowadays?</p>

<p>Lord Warlock entirely agreed with the goddaughter
of Bean. Alas, the world had fallen upon evil days
indeed!</p>

<p>“But I think, ma’am, you have a devilish sensible
granddaughter, if I may say so.”</p>

<p>Grandmamma hoped her granddaughter was sensible,
although to her mind it seemed that she had not
married very prudently.</p>

<p>No brains, certainly, agreed my lord&mdash;speaking of
the young chap, of course&mdash;but perhaps a young chap
was just as well without ’em, provided his income was
large enough to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>However, it was more a Question of Principle to the
mind of Grandmamma. And a Question of Principle
is, of course, a great matter. The stage and the peerage
had so little in common that they were best kept
apart. Not, to be sure, that Grandmamma was blind
to the worldly advantages, but then, to one who had
played Lady Macbeth to John Peter Kendall, worldly
advantages were not everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Mary and Philip undoubtedly interrupted an agreeable
<i>tête-à-tête</i>. But the Ex-Ambassador shook hands
with them both, and informed Mary once more how
devilish obliged he was for the improvement that had
already been wrought in his rheumatism. Mary was
delighted to hear that, of course; and she rang for more
tea and ordered <i>heaps</i> of hot buttered cakes; and Pa
was so genial that this might never have been the creature
who had stolen a march on Adela.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip, it must be admitted, was not very conversational.
Even in the most favorable circumstances
he was a silent young man. But Mary could talk
enough for two, or enough for twenty if it came to
that, being one of those gifted young women who are
never at a loss in any society. Yet she was tactful, of
course, with this Grecian gift&mdash;yes, it is a Grecian
gift, you young ladies of Newnham and Girton; and
if you possess this valuable faculty to the degree that
Mary did, be like her and never, never abuse it.</p>

<p>The Tactful Young Madam hoped that Lord Warlock
would excuse their unconventional attire. They
had been playing football for the benefit of the widow
and five young children of the late Joe McPherson, and
ten thousand people had been present and quite a substantial
sum was likely to be raised, and if Lord Warlock
would be so kind as to give her the sovereign he
had promised her for the Fund she would have great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>pleasure in forwarding it to the Treasurer, and she
was sure the Treasurer would have equal pleasure in
receiving it, because the Cause was so Deserving.</p>

<p>Pa paid up there and then, like a fine old Irish
gentleman and a sportsman to boot; and Mary promised
to send on the receipt as soon as she received it; and
my lord said the receipt was of no consequence; and
Mary, with her square and sensible face, said a receipt
was always of consequence; not that she contradicted Pa
at all rudely, you know, as we fear another young
person has been known to do on occasion.</p>

<p>She then explained that their side had won the match
by two goals to one, and that the winning goal had
been scored by Philip; and my lord remarked that a
devilish good game was polo, and it was a great pity we
had allowed the Cup to go to America, and we must
send a good team and plenty of ponies and get it back
again; in which the Siddons’-cap-of-real-lace concurred
with great spirit, and affirmed her conviction that there
had been negligence somewhere.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall just muddle along until Uncle Jonathan
annexes us, and then we shall begin to wake up
a bit, I daresay.”</p>

<p>And everybody laughed loudly, of course, at the
caustic Ambassadorial Humor.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t polo they had been playing, says little
Miss Newnham, with her passion for exactitude. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>course it wasn’t, my dear. Then why didn’t Mary say
so? Her Tact again, my dear. It always bores a
real live ex-ambassador to have to stand corrected;
and football is so plebeian that polo sounds nicer; and
it really didn’t matter a straw, so there was no use in
being tediously literal, was there?</p>

<p>You don’t see the point of the argument, and you
still think, my dear, it was Mary’s duty to make it
clear that the game was football. Sorry not to agree
with <i>you</i>, Miss Newnham; but we are sure we shall
have the sanction of all parents and guardians when
we lay down the axiom that it is a chief part of the
whole duty of Woman never to bore an ambassador.</p>

<p>Had Mary been tediously literal she would probably
not have received an invitation to Hurlingham any
afternoon she cared to come during the season, which
she promptly accepted with becoming gratitude. And
then, before the Ex-Ambassador could take up his hat
and rise from the sofa, she had asked the important question,
Could Lord Warlock be so <i>very</i> kind as to give
her advice how to get Philip into Parliament?</p>

<p>There was a question for you! Give <i>her</i> advice,
mark you, young ladies. There was a great deal in
that. The Ex-Ambassador fixed his monocle, of course,
with a little pardonable magniloquence of bearing, like
any other ex-ambassador would have done; looked about
as wise as you make ’em, and said in the sharp dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>manner that he had really copied from his father who
had copied it from Mr. Rogers, although that was a
secret that lay with him in his grave&mdash;and what did
the Ex-Ambassador say?</p>

<p>He said the best way to get into Parliament is to
see that you keep out of it....</p>

<p>How very deep and subtle; quite worthy of Mr.
Punch at his best, say all parents and guardians.</p>

<p><i>We</i> can’t see the point of the reply, say the dreadfully
literal young ladies of Newnham and Girton.</p>

<p>Well, if you really can’t, my dears, it is not for
us to attempt to explain it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that was the Ambassadorial reply; and real
Tact&mdash;the genuine guaranteed article&mdash;in the person
of Mistress Mary was delighted with this brilliant
<i>mot</i>; and the real lace of Siddons immensely
admired its <i>esprit</i>, and said quite audibly to the crochet-work
antimacassar “that it was worthy of dear Dicky
Milnes”; and the Ex-Ambassador, still feeling quite
comfortable on the sofa, in spite of the fact that the
springs were broken and that the stuffing was distributed
so unevenly, thought he might just as well stay another
five minutes.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the extension of the
visit was entirely due to Mary’s tact. And now, young
ladies, let us see the use that she made of it.</p>

<p>“If only there would be a vacancy at Blackhampton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
I think I could get him in myself, because I really
think I have got Blackhampton in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“A very right and proper place in which to keep
a borough; it was in our time, Mrs. Cathcart, eh?”</p>

<p>The Siddons’ cap and the inheritor of the Rogers
tradition had this delectable morsel all to themselves.
The brain of Mary the Tactful was much too busy marshalling
its battalions, and Mr. Philip was far too much
interested in hot buttered tea-cake, which he had certainly
earned, to be able to follow the conversation
except at a very respectful distance. Therefore the
continued <i>esprit</i> of my lord was like to have gone unhonored
save for Granny, who could have imagined
Sydney Smith, etc.</p>

<p>So, after all, it was really as much due to the Siddons’
cap that the five minutes grew into ten; and
this further extension was rather important, since Mary
was busy posing the mighty problem how could she get
this absentee Irish landlord, who was bound by the nature
of the case to be a Vandeleurite, to play the game
of a perfectly ferocious Balsquithian.</p>

<p>“You see, Lord Warlock, I want my Philip to go
into Parliament, but we don’t know anybody who has
got any influence with Mr. Balsquith, because all our
friends are on the other side.”</p>

<p>A very nicely calculated candor, Miss Mary; well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>might the Ex-Ambassador present a picture of amiable
cynicism.</p>

<p>“Seems to me, then, you had better apply to the
other party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Lord Warlock. My Philip is nothing like
clever enough to be a Vandeleurite.”</p>

<p>Rather sacrificing her lord, though, wasn’t she, on
the altar of high diplomacy? Not that Mr. Philip
minded that particularly. Hot buttered tea-cake was
of far more consequence than anything that had transpired
up to the present.</p>

<p>The Ex-Ambassador was constrained to feel that the
ambitious young woman’s reasoning was sound. The
young hussy then proceeded to draw her next card out
of the pack, and it wasn’t a very bad one, either.</p>

<p>“You see, Lord Warlock, I am so keen for my
Philip to go into politics, as I want people to say that
the best day’s work he ever did was when he married
me.”</p>

<p>There was only one reply for an old diplomatist to
make to this engaging candor. It is hardly necessary
to say that no time was lost in making it.</p>

<p>How did Mary, who is really too pushing to be quite
nice, in my opinion, receive the obviously insincere
compliment that was paid to her? says our little friend
Miss Newnham. She didn’t say a word, my dear, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>she blushed quite charmingly&mdash;at least, the Ex-Ambassador
thought she did&mdash;and then that absolutely
direct glance of about two thousand candle-power came
right at the noble earl, who proceeded to register on
the tablets of his worldly wise old mind the following
pearl of wisdom: No Wonder The Young Fools Marry
’Em Nowadays.</p>

<p>“So you want to get him into Parliament, do you&mdash;as
a Rag?” mused the old cynic.</p>

<p>“Dear Lord Warlock, if you would only give me
a little advice, I am really so ignorant!”</p>

<p>There was just room for two persons on the decrepit
sofa that had the honor of holding my lord. Would
it bear the weight of both of ’em? was another poser for
Mary the Tactful. She would risk it, anyhow; and so
she sat down beside the Ex-Ambassador in a charmingly
impulsive manner, and said, “Dear Lord Warlock, do
help me,” and very nearly slew one who had grown old
in the world with her good gray eyes.</p>

<p>It may almost be laid down as an axiom that ex-ambassadors
are pretty deep as a rule. This one was
certainly not an exception. Not only did his dark and
self-contained appearance suggest considerable guile,
but this picturesque impression was amply confirmed
by the fascinating curves of his intellect. In fine, my
lords and gentlemen, His Britannic Majesty’s Ex-Ambassador<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
to Persia was a long way from being a
fool.</p>

<p>Therefore he made no immediate reply to Mary the
Tactful. But the Pushful Young Hussy&mdash;as every
young married woman should be, my dear Miss Newnham&mdash;knew
perfectly well that she had given the fellow-occupant
of the sofa to think. As a matter of fact,
the fellow-occupant thought considerable, and somewhat
to this tenor.</p>

<p>I am not very pleased with Vandeleur just now. He
as good as promised me that vacant Thistle, but he
gave it to Blougram instead, who, of course, has not
rendered one-tenth of my services to the Empire.
Then this young fool is the eldest son of an old fool
who takes himself far too seriously&mdash;an old fool who
has jobbed his way into unmerited favor, and has done
as much as anybody, outside the perfectly appalling
Front Bench, to ruin the party. Well, I owe Vandeleur
a grudge; I can’t abide pompous mediocrity; I’m feeling
rather mischievous just now with this ill-tempered
girl o’ mine left on my hands, when she ought to have
been settled five years ago; and if the successor to
Van’s very last and very worst creation goes over lock,
stock and barrel to the Rag, Tag and Bobtails, legs are
going to be pulled pretty badly all round, eh?</p>

<p>We hope the reasoning of the noble lord is clear to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>all parents and guardians. Certainly it is a little advanced
for the junior members of the congregation.
We have done our humble best to make it as lucid as
possible, but the mental processes of an Ex-Ambassador
call for the very nicest skill on the part of our Pegasus,
who was never a very agile beast, at his best, and age
don’t improve him.</p>

<p>Mary the Tactful waited quite a minute for the
Fellow-Occupant to break the silence. And then
into little pieces the silence was shattered.</p>

<p>“I don’t say I’ve any influence with Balsquith, but I
might throw out a hint to Huffham and MacMurdo and
the other Rag, Tag and Bobtail wire pullers that your
man would like to stand for ’em, and a very able man,
too.”</p>

<p>Tactful Mary was breathless with gratitude. But
not for a moment did her statesmanlike grasp desert
her.</p>

<p>“Some large manufacturing town&mdash;Leeds or Bootle,
or Sheffield, or Blackhampton, where they’d remember
my Cinderella, and where I’ve presented medals, and
where I’ve sung at concerts, when they’ve brought home
T’Coop. If Free Trade and I can’t get him in in any
of those places, where they know a Cinderella when they
see one&mdash;”</p>

<p>The granddaughter of the goddaughter of Edward
Bean burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>There was the grim light of Humor also in the ambassadorial
eye.</p>

<p>“Best thing you can do, Mrs. Shelmerdine,” said
Worldly Wisdom, “is to see that your young chap
writes a nice sensible letter to Balsquith, stating his
views clearly in as few words as he can; and in the
meantime I’ll sow a few myself, and get Huffham or
MacMurdo to meet him at lunch at the Helicon; and if
at the next bye-election one Vandeleur don’t get his leg
pulled, I’m better fitted to eat Thistles than to wear
’em.”</p>

<p>Even Mary the Tactful, whose knowledge of the
world was so immense, hardly appreciated the full flavor
of the latter remark; but what she did appreciate, and
quite keenly, too, was the enormous importance of those
that had preceded it.</p>

<p>She didn’t overdo her gratitude because ex-ambassadors
are not at all partial to Fuss. She thanked my
lord very simply and sincerely; but she let the good
gray eyes do most of the work, and very charmingly
they did it. A very sensible girl, who will make a good
wife for anybody, and I only wish that insolent wench
of mine had got half her brains, thought the Ambassadorial
One. Not that he said so to Mary the Tactful;
although, strictly between ourselves, young ladies
of Newnham and Girton, she wouldn’t have minded
very much if he had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Lord Warlock took his leave at last, having passed
quite an agreeable hour, whereas he had but expected a
formal perfunctory ten minutes. It had been indeed
a pleasure to meet Mrs. Cathcart again; and we have
seen what an impression the granddaughter had made
upon the old diplomatist. Yes, he assured the latter,
a word in season should reach the chiefs of the Party.
It was rash to make promises, but he hoped and believed&mdash;particularly
as the Rags were always on the
look-out for young men of family in order to redress
the balance a bit&mdash;Mr. Philip might find himself in
the midst of a bye-election in the not distant future.</p>

<p>This was imparted to Mary in strict confidence, while
she conducted the visitor downstairs. And when the
young minx had sped my lord over the doorstep with
her picture-postcard smile, she came up the stairs again,
two at a time, with the air of one who has really done
something clever.</p>

<p>“And now, Phil-ipp,” said she, “you must go at
once and have a nice warm bath; and I will go to the
chemist’s and get something for those poor feet.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="smaller">IS OF A POLITICAL NATURE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Granny’s</span> fortnight at Brighton was so successful
that it ran to a month. In the latter part of the period
Philip and Mary paid several flying visits to the metropolis
to see if the little flat in Knightsbridge was coming
up to expectations. The furniture also had to be considered,
and a very pleasant occupation it was to collect
the household gods.</p>

<p>Everything in the new house delighted them; the
color of the walls, the light in the pictures, the hang
of the curtains, the disposition of the chairs. It was
about the first week in April when they started housekeeping
for themselves. They had found a very warm
and cozy little nest, rather high up perhaps, yet a nest
is none the worse for that as a rule. It overlooked the
park in which the birds were building, and in which
Philip, who had turned over an entirely new leaf, used
to ride before breakfast.</p>

<p>Mary’s first cross in her new life was that she couldn’t
accompany him. But she had never been on a horse
in her life; and she very much regretted now that this
branch of her education had been neglected. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>must be pals in everything. Wherever he went and
whatever he did, she must be at his side&mdash;that is, if he
wanted her, and she was quite sure he did.</p>

<p>As became a very practical-minded young woman,
she soon came to grips with this important subject. It
was one day after lunch, while the world was still seeming
a truly magnificent place to be in, and life still appeared
a truly noble and glorious invention.</p>

<p>“Phil-ipp, there is only one cloud so far.”</p>

<p>“What is it, old girl?”</p>

<p>“I want to ride, Phil-ipp, and I don’t know how. I
think I shall learn. Come with me and order a habit,
although at a really economical shop, because I’m not
earning no money and I’ve broken all my contracts and
this is going to be a dreadful Expense.”</p>

<p>Philip was delighted and praised her pluck; but, in
strict confidence, young ladies of Newnham and Girton,
she didn’t exactly overflow with that valuable commodity
when she made her début a week later at the
school. Her second and third appearances were hardly
more inspiring; indeed, she had never felt so uncomfortable,
so nervous, so hopelessly incompetent in the
whole course of a life which had been a brilliant success
so far. But she stuck to her resolve with the whole-hearted
determination that goes with her type of countenance;
and ere long virtue began to reap its reward.</p>

<p>It was a very proud moment when, after several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>weeks of travail, she ventured forth into the Row with
her Philip, about a quarter-past eight of a summer’s
morning. Philip felt awfully proud of her, for, making
due allowance for a little inward trepidation which
was uncommonly well concealed, she really did very well
indeed. She vowed, moreover, though in no spirit of
vainglory, that she meant soon to do much better.</p>

<p>Friends of the Family had shaken their heads, and
were shaking them still, over the Unfortunate Occurrence,
but at present the glamour had shown no signs
of wearing thin. Mary had definitely retired from the
theater, except for the promised appearance at Harry
Merino’s benefit, which had yet to take place, but in the
most whole-hearted way she was devoting herself to
Philip and his interests. It was her ambition “to be
a pal in everything.” The sitting of a horse was only
one instance of her determination to live up to her
ideal.</p>

<p>An Ex-Ambassador had asked her to call in Mount
Street. No time was lost in taking him at his word.
Moreover, she chose a day and hour when the old diplomatist
was accessible. And her recent study of the art
of equitation came in uncommonly useful, inasmuch that
without much difficulty she contrived “to keep him up
to the bit.” That is to say, about ten days after her
visit Philip received an invitation to lunch at the Helicon,
to meet a chief wire-puller of the party to which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>Ex-Ambassador did not belong. It is not every young
married woman of limited social experience who would
have been able to manage it.</p>

<p>To be quite candid, Sir Joseph Huffham, Bart., M.
P., was not exactly overpowered by the sense of Mr.
Philip’s ability. To that shrewd and stern judge of
mankind, the son and heir of that old fool Shelmerdine
was very much what one would have expected him to
be. Except that he was not pompous. On the contrary,
there was a most agreeable modesty about the
young chap. It was evidently sincere, and as such was
entitled to respect. As far as promise was concerned,
though there was doubtless a good deal of it&mdash;a
worldly-wise man had said so&mdash;whatever he might attain
to in the way of performance would be in the distant
future.</p>

<p>What had Warlock in his mind? was really the question
of questions for Sir Joseph Huffham, Bart., M. P.
What Machiavellian subtlety lurked in the bringing forward
of this very dark horse for the purpose of helping
a party in which Warlock was not interested? What
private axe had he to grind? To be sure, there was that
little business of the vacant Thistle, which all the world
and his wife had smiled over. Then there was also the
fact that this not particularly bright young man had
disappointed the expectations of two families. What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>game was the old Jesuit playing? was the question that
Sir Joseph felt constrained to ask.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph found the question by no means easy to
answer, and we must confess that we share his difficulty.
It would be idle, my lords and gentlemen, for us to
pretend to illuminate the official prescience. But candidly,
we feel that the question might have been addressed
to young Mrs. Philip without impropriety, although,
of course, Sir Joseph could not be expected to
know that, and he would have thought it ridiculous had
anyone ventured to make the suggestion. Things don’t
happen in that way, he would have said.</p>

<p>Maybe, Sir Joseph; yet perchance in that case you
would have affirmed but half a truth. It takes a pretty
bold man these days to say exactly how things do happen,
Monsieur Bergson seems to think.</p>

<p>Still, Sir Joseph certainly thought it was piquant that
the son of S. of P. should desire to help the Party.
His qualifications for public life appeared to be rather
obscure, but being the eldest son of his father he was
not without a face value for the enemy.</p>

<p>“And so, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said the illustrious man,
smiling over the club claret, “you think, with your
wife’s assistance, you might be able to win a seat like
South-West Blackhampton for the party of progress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“My wife is sure she could win it for me,” was the
answer of Philip.</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, the answer to be expected from
a champion of the democracy; and the illustrious man
looked rather quizzically across the table at his host.
Were he and his party going to have their legs pulled
in company with Van and the other side? Never trust
an Irishman on principle, was one of Sir Joseph’s axioms;
and in this case he rather felt like living up
to it.</p>

<p>All the same, the exigencies of the situation called
for a man somewhat out of the ordinary for South-West
Blackhampton. At present that large and important
industrial constituency was represented by a
man of independent mind who owed allegiance to none.
The power of his personality had carried him to the
top of the poll in a three-cornered contest, in spite of
the fact that he had an official Rag and an official
Wagger, able men both, against him.</p>

<p>Good, sound, conventional candidates had failed
against this Rawhead and Bloodybones. It was just
possible that the husband of a favorite actress, and a
famous footballer to boot, might be successful where
his betters might fail. That, at least, was the local
opinion.</p>

<p>“I presume, Mr. Shelmerdine,” said Sir Joseph Huffham,
“in the event of your being adopted as a candidate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
for South-West Blackhampton, you would have no
objection to signing a&mdash;er&mdash;” Sir Joseph paused
while he took a type-written document from his pocket-book
and adjusted his pince-nez&mdash;“a football league
form for the Blackhampton Rovers?”</p>

<p>Mr. Shelmerdine was quite prepared to do that.</p>

<p>“And of playing for them occasionally, I presume, if
your services were called upon?”</p>

<p>Mr. Shelmerdine had no objection to doing that,
either, although he was rather short of practice these
days.</p>

<p>“I am informed, Mr. Shelmerdine, that you kicked
three goals against Scotland in an International match.”</p>

<p>With excellent modesty the young man admitted this
impeachment.</p>

<p>“Well, I think I am entitled to say, Mr. Shelmerdine,”
said Sir Joseph, who was himself a pretty shrewd
Lancastrian, “if you can kick three goals against Liverpool
or Manchester City in an important League match,
you are very likely to be returned at the top of the
poll.”</p>

<p>Very simply and seriously, and quite sincerely, Mr.
Shelmerdine promised to do his best in this matter,
and that when the time came, if South-West Blackhampton
did him the honor of adopting him as their
candidate, he would go into strict training for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Sir Joseph had the reputation of being the possessor
of a sense of humor, and the Ex-Ambassador had a few
ideas also upon that recondite subject; but each of these
gentlemen smiled very warily at the other, as though
he was not quite certain whether it would be safe in
the circumstances to allow his mobile fancy to play
around that which had rather the appearance of a jest
on the surface. Had they not mistrusted one another
so sorely, they might have been tempted to do so; but
the odd thing was that the prospective candidate for
South-West Blackhampton respected their <i>bona fides</i>
so immensely that he remained a perfect image of
gravity.</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sir, to kick three goals against
Liverpool or Manchester City,” said the young man as
he shook hands and took his leave.</p>

<p>“Then I think you may be returned to Parliament,”
said the shrewd Lancastrian cordially; “that is, if you
never hold a meeting without having your wife on the
platform; and you let her do most of the talking, you
know.”</p>

<p>It was frankness, certainly, on the part of Sir Joseph
Huffham, Bart., M. P.; but that illustrious man owed
much of his eminence to the fact that he had a pretty
sound working knowledge of things in general.</p>

<p>“I will certainly do that, sir,” said the young man.</p>

<p>Whereupon he thanked Sir Joseph and the Ex-Ambassador<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
with great sincerity, and went his way along
Pall Mall; and as he did this he was just the happiest
young man in all the great Metropolis. It was a genuine
inspiration that Mary should make the speeches.
He would attend to the goal-kicking department all
right. He would go into strict training, knock off
tobacco, lead the life of an anchorite. And when
he found himself in Parliament as a full-blown Rag,
he would be able to say that she had done it all.</p>

<p>Hitherto Mr. Philip had not been encumbered with
anything so superfluous as political convictions. He
had known in a dim kind of way that the friends of
his youth had been Waggers. Without the Waggers,
he had always been given to understand there would
have been no turn-up with the Boers in South Africa.
He had borne a humble part in that little affair, along
with the rest of his friends; and the best he could say
for it was that he had found it rather an overrated
amusement. But without the Waggers, so he understood,
there would not have been fair play for everybody.</p>

<p>However, this was the only good thing he knew about
the Waggers. His father was a Wagger, of course,
like everybody else’s father was; but if you have quarrelled
with your father, there is all the less reason to
stick to the same school of political thought. But
Mary it was who had really converted him, and had made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>him go into Parliament. She declared herself to be
an absolutely ferocious Rag-Tag-and-Bobtail, and that,
of course, in the present state of the domestic firmament,
was quite enough for Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>The Rags, as Mary expounded their faith, were the
party of Progress and the friends of the People.
And now that he was enlisted in their ranks, he felt it
behoved him to live up to their exalted principles.
Therefore he gave a shilling to the crossing-sweeper at
the bottom of Saint James’s Street, and, like a true
democrat, proceeded on foot to the little nest in Knightsbridge,
instead of going like the son of a lord in a
taxi.</p>

<p>Mary was buried in a delightfully comfortable chair
with her toes on the fender. She was also reading a
novel; and out of our love for her we must really withhold
the name of the author.</p>

<p>... No, young ladies of Newnham and Girton,
the name of the author was not Monsieur Anatole
France.</p>

<p>“I’ve done it, old girl,” said Mr. Philip, bursting in
upon her and saluting her, of course, in the manner
ordained by custom for newly-married people. “I
really think they are going to take me on.”</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, young man, you had not done
it. It was Mary who had done all the doing so far;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>although, of course, you could hardly be expected to
realize that.</p>

<p>“Oh, how splendid!”</p>

<p>“Yes, old girl; and old Sir Joseph Thingamy&mdash;nice
old boy&mdash;says you are to attend all the meetings
and make most of the speeches, and I’m to sign a
League form for Blackhampton Rovers and kick three
goals against Liverpool, and everything will be as right
as rain.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it will, Phil-ipp, when I’ve got dear
old Blackhampton in my pocket.”</p>

<p>And Mary flung away her novel, and rose with the
light of battle in her eye in order to confirm this startling
announcement.</p>

<p>A general election was expected in October. The
head office said things must be put in train at once.
Communications had, of course, to pass between the
constituency and Westminster, but within a month Mr.
Philip had received an invitation from the Chief Tribesmen
of South-West Blackhampton to come forth and
make the acquaintance with his views.</p>

<p>Then it was that Mr. Philip found himself in a bit
of a funk. The fact was that he hadn’t any views&mdash;at
least, any views to speak about. Party of progress;
government of the People, by the People, for the People;
greatest good of the greatest number, and so forth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>That was all he knew, and you couldn’t very well make
a speech out of that, could you?</p>

<p>With this, however, Mary didn’t quite agree. She
seemed to think you could. She had been reading up
the subject lately. Therefore she sat down at once,
pen in hand, and began to collect her ideas upon the
subject.</p>

<p>In common with other ready-witted people, she had
the useful faculty of being fluent on paper. By lunch-time
she had covered ten pages of foolscap, writing on
one side of the paper only; and after lunch, when over
the cigarettes and coffee she read the result of her
labors aloud to the future member for South-West
Blackhampton, the young man found it hard to repress
his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“I shall have ’em absolutely stiff,” said he; “that is,
if I can only remember it all. But I say, old girl, what
if they begin to ask questions?”</p>

<p>“Tell them, Phil-ipp, that you believe in Mr. Balsquith;
and that anything he votes for you’ll vote for,
because you know that <i>he</i> can’t go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right, old girl, but a chap is expected
to have a bit of a mind of his own, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“Dear, no&mdash;pray <i>why</i> should he have?” And this
worldly wise young wife started on cigarette the second,
we are rather sorry to say, because one should suffice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
after lunch even for a young married woman. Still,
the circumstances were exceptional.</p>

<p>“Trust Mr. Balsquith, and South-West Blackhampton
will trust you. Now start learning your speech, like
a good boy; and you must repeat it to me word for
word every morning from memory, so that you’ll be all
right on the night and absolutely word perfect.”</p>

<p>As an instance of Providence in one of its less atrabilious
humors, it befell that Philip was invited to meet
the local committee in the evening following the one in
which Mary was to appear at the Royal Italian Opera
House for the benefit of Harry Merino. Thus they
were able to stay together at the best hotel in Blackhampton,
and to feel that they were killing, as it were,
two birds with a single stone.</p>

<p>It was perfectly true that at Blackhampton the name
of Mary Caspar ranked high with the population. It
was in the largest type on every hoarding; her portrait
appeared in the window of every other shop; her
wonderful smile that wouldn’t come off was to be seen
on countless picture-postcards; an illustrated interview
with the general favorite was printed in the <i>Blackhampton
Courier</i>.</p>

<p>When she walked down Market Street to do a little
shopping on the afternoon of her arrival in the borough,
she caused almost as much commotion as if she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>been Royalty itself. And in the opinion of her escort,
a very nice-looking, well-grown and well-groomed young
man in white spats and a blue suiting, the last word in
neatness, and a bowler hat, of course the last word of
fashion, she was indeed the Queen of Blackhampton.
Moreover, a large percentage of the passers-by concurred
with the nice-looking young man in so thinking.</p>

<p>Yes, she was the acknowledged Queen of Blackhampton;
in the eyes of the passers-by the fact was stated.
It was perfectly true that she had got this constituency
in her pocket; and Blackhampton, although hardly
aware of the fact, was mightily proud to be there.</p>

<p>They came in their thousands to welcome her back
to that sphere of life she ought never to have deserted.
Their reception almost brought tears to her eyes, it
was so spontaneous, so hearty, and so genuine. The
Royal Italian Opera House could have been filled ten
times over; not, of course, that this was due to Mary
alone. Other stars were giving their services; and
Harry Merino, upon whom evil times had fallen, was
as good a comedian as ever colored his nose and delighted
the world with irresistible natural humor.</p>

<p>It was at the Royal at Blackhampton that she had
really begun her great career. Blackhampton had been
the making of her, said Mr. Byles, the famous Lessee
and Manager of the Royal, and that great man was
accustomed to deal with hard facts. Blackhampton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>believed it, anyway; and Mary believed it also. At
least, she confessed as much to Mr. Byles, while the
chest of the lessee grew so large that it seemed that his
watch-chain of twenty-two carat gold must really break
from its moorings.</p>

<p>“Polly, my gal, I’m proud o’ you!”&mdash;there was deep
emotion in the manly voice of the Lessee and Manager;
and if “the Young Pup” had not been present, it is
most likely that Mr. Byles would have hugged the future
peeress publicly.</p>

<p>Yes, they were very hearty, genuine people at Blackhampton.
The Principal Girl of three Royal pantomimes
was to them an imperishable memory. In the
divine order of womanhood the Queen of England ranked
first in their estimation; Mary Caspar ranked second;
and the third place was reserved for the Duchess of
Dumbarton, although local opinion was rather averse
from the peerage merely as such.</p>

<p>It was probable that one such as Mr. Philip would
find a difficult row to hoe in Blackhampton. They
hadn’t much use for frills as a general thing. If the
young man was going to stand for Blackhampton, it
was by no means clear that those white spats were not
an error of judgment. But the general opinion was
that even a future hereditary legislator might be returned
for Blackhampton if he happened to be Mary
Caspar’s husband, and that he signed a league form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>for the Rovers, and kicked a few goals against Aston
Villa.</p>

<p>He was a nice-looking young gentleman certainly,
said feminine Blackhampton; a little too fine for the
district, perhaps, and yet they were by no means sure
of that. Good looks, a good tailor and easy, natural
manners tell even at Blackhampton among the ladies;
and even there, as in more sophisticated places, public
opinion is susceptible to their judgments.</p>

<p>Alderman Slocock, J. P., the leading Rag statesman
for twenty miles around, presided at the meeting of
the executive committee at the Gladstone Club. The
proceedings were of a strictly private character; ladies
were not admitted; Mary could not be present; and in
consequence The Pup longed for his coffin even before
the proceedings started.</p>

<p>Alderman Slocock made a very long speech from the
chair. The prospective candidate would be given every
opportunity to express his views at length; but before
coming to that part of the programme, Alderman Slocock,
a master-hairdresser, with no fewer than twenty-four
shops spread over the district, spoke for nearly an
hour.</p>

<p>It was not a very opportune beginning, since the
longer the master-hairdresser went on, the more intense
grew Mr. Philip’s desire for a speedy burial; moreover,
the other members of the committee were growing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>decidedly restless. But at last came the fateful moment
when the Candidate was called upon to express
his views; and then arose the question for gods and
men, would the Candidate be able to remember them?</p>

<p>For three solid weeks, every morning and every
night, from memory had he repeated to Mary his
speech. There must be no doubt as to his ability to
cope with this great ordeal. When he entered the Gladstone
Club he would have wagered that he was absolutely
word perfect; but as soon as he got on his legs he was
paralyzed with the knowledge that he couldn’t remember
a syllable.</p>

<p>To begin with, his throat was so terribly dry that he
was bound to have recourse to a liquid aid to eloquence
before he “could come to the horses.” But there were
broad-minded men and advanced thinkers on the Executive
Committee who rather approved this weakness
because it showed that the Candidate was human
like themselves, and they thought none the worse of
him for it. On the other hand, there were representatives
of Little Bethel in this august assembly who
deplored the Candidate’s early recourse to whisky and
water.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, began the wretched
Philip, in a thin, small voice. Oh, joy! at the instance
of those familiar words the speech suddenly began
to flow automatically into his mind. Members of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>Gladstone Club, Electors of Blackhampton&mdash;the cunning
young minx had said that this style of address
was bound to sound well in the ears of the Committee&mdash;I
have followed with the closest attention and I may
say with deep admiration, the speech from Alderman
Slocock to which we have just had the pleasure of listening.
I cannot understand how it is, gentlemen, that
having a man like Alderman Slocock in your midst,
you should go outside your fine old city, of which I am
sure you must be awfully proud, to look for a man
worthy to represent it in Parliament. (Loud applause
which bucked up the candidate considerably.)</p>

<p>Let us pay no idle compliment to the authoress of
the speech, but we are by no means clear that the young
madam did not know more about the rules of the game
than augurs well for the peace of mind of the coming
generation which may have to cope with her sex on the
green benches.</p>

<p>Certainly this felicitous opening seemed to put the
candidate on good terms with his audience. Things
began to go very well. The voice was good; the manner,
of course, what you would expect from the Twin
Brethren; the matter was sound so far as it went, and
very wisely it did not go further than amiable generalities.
He was the son of a lord undoubtedly, but it
was clear that he was much above the average of his
class.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>
<p>The end of his ordeal was not yet, however. Alderman
Slocock had a few questions to ask.</p>

<p>Would the Candidate be good enough to enlighten the
Committee as to the nature of his views upon the subject
of Free Trade?</p>

<p>Sir, I shall be most happy, said the Candidate, smiling
graciously. Gentlemen, my views on the subject of
Free Trade are those of Mr. Balsquith, and it is a matter
upon which I trust his judgment implicitly.</p>

<p>The Committee was much gratified by this statesmanlike
reply.</p>

<p>And the question of the House of Lords? said Alderman
Slocock. The Committee would be happy to have
the Candidate’s views upon that vexed subject.</p>

<p>The views of the Candidate in respect of the House
of Lords were those of Mr. Balsquith; that also was
a subject upon which he trusted Mr. Balsquith’s judgment
implicitly.</p>

<p>This answer was equally successful; and as it did
duty for all the questions that followed, the Candidate
was guilty of nothing that was likely to efface the
highly favorable effect he had already created. Therefore
he was able to return to the best hotel in Blackhampton
reasonably secure in the conviction that he
was about to be chosen as the official representative of
the Rags.</p>

<p>Of course he would be, he was promptly informed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>Mary, who was sitting up for him, if he had remembered
his words.</p>

<p>“Fact is, old girl,” confided Mr. Philip, “I knew
I’d got ’em fixed up before I’d got half through my
bally speech.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Phil-ipp, you were bound to have.”</p>

<p>And she was far too good a sportswoman to remind
the vainglorious orator that it was not his speech at
all. But don’t let us praise her too much. For the
simple fact was that it pleased her mightily to think
that it really was his speech that had carried the day,
and that she had nothing whatever to do with it. Moreover,
she was perfectly willing for him to believe that
it was his speech; and certainly, so high had success
lifted her lord just now that it didn’t really seem very
difficult for him to do so. And for our own poor
part, we have never been able to determine which phenomenon
is the more curious: whether Man should plume
himself beyond his deserts at the expense of Woman
or whether Woman should derive a keen pleasure from
aiding and abetting him in the deception.</p>

<p>Howbeit, so deep was the impression that Mr. Philip
Shelmerdine’s signal ability, in combination with his
air of manly sincerity and straightforwardness, made
upon the Committee, that no time was lost in inviting
him to stand as a Rag, Tag and Bobtail for South-West
Blackhampton.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="smaller">IS VICTORIAN IN THE BEST SENSE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Grosvenor Square, at this period, rose-color was
not the prevailing hue. The Proconsul had declined to
attend the wedding. Moreover, he had given Mr.
Philip clearly to understand that Mrs. Philip would not
be <i>persona gratissima</i> in Grosvenor Square. The attitude
was perfectly “regular” in the circumstances; all
the same, it hardly increased the common stock of
human amenity. And he was quite an affectionate father,
even if a somewhat despotic one, which, after all,
is not an unexpected trait in a middle-aged gentleman
who has made a great success of the art of governing
others.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Proconsul is hardly one to commend
to parents and guardians in general. And unfortunately
Mother upheld the Proconsul in his frowardness.
She, too, as had so many Colthursts of Suffolk
before her, formed the fatal habit of governing
others. And she, too, having been thwarted in a pet
design, and moreover, having had to submit to a pretty
shrewd buffet from the venerable relative of The Person,
was inclined to behave with unwisdom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>
<p>It is a great pity that Grosvenor Square has to be
shown in this light. Both Father and Mother ought
really to have known so very much better. It was really
very wrong; and they made themselves rather miserable
into the bargain.</p>

<p>Mother thought Father ought to have been firmer.
Father thought that Mother ought to have kept clear
of Bedford Gardens, and all would have been well.
Mother thought that Father’s handling of the whole
matter was hardly worthy of a Proconsul. Father
was grieved that Agatha should talk in that way, since
it would be idle to pretend that she had shown her usual
Tact.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was one aspect of the affair that
really astonished both of them immensely. It was the
attitude taken up by a much-injured man and a thwarted
father-in-law when they ventured to condole with him,
and perhaps incidentally to obtain a little balm for
their own wounded feelings.</p>

<p>Father and Mother were frankly amazed that their
standpoint had to forego the sanction of His Britannic
Majesty’s Ambassador to Persia.</p>

<p>“Fact is, Shelmerdine,” said my lord, “the young
fool has done a dashed sight better for himself than by
marrying this girl of mine.”</p>

<p>Mother was amazed at such levity proceeding from
such a quarter; and rather pointedly she said so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“We must look facts in the face,” said my lord
robustly. “She is an uncommonly able young woman,
and one of these days you’ll remember that I’ve said
so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I like ability in women,” said
Mother.</p>

<p>Oh, Mother! And you, by common consent, one of
the ablest women in Grosvenor Square and its environs.</p>

<p>“It’s a useful thing to keep in the house, though,”
said the Ex-Ambassador.</p>

<p>Still, Mother was not in the least resigned to what
she considered an exhibition of cynicism.</p>

<p>“One is really surprised at <i>you</i>, Lord Warlock&mdash;you
who know the world so well.”</p>

<p>And yet it would be hardly safe to assume that
Mother was wholly sincere in her admonition of this
elderly diplomatist. She didn’t subscribe to his ignoble
point of view; she never could and never would subscribe
to it; but it would hardly be safe to assume that
Mother was seriously displeased that a man of such
penetration should entertain it.</p>

<p>Still, she had to labor the Victorian Attitude a little
in order to cope with one so unexpected.</p>

<p>“If only she had been a&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Ex-Ambassadorial chuckle brought Mother up
short.</p>

<p>“We shall see what we shall see, dear lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Mother wished my lord would not be so cryptic. All
the same, she rather liked the air of confidence.</p>

<p>“An old professional family, even of that kind,
must have gathered its traditions, Agatha,” said S.
of P.</p>

<p>“Fact is, Shelmerdine,” said the Friend of the Family,
“the young fellow has done a dashed sight better
than anybody thinks he has&mdash;and a dashed sight better
than he deserves, if you want my candid opinion.”</p>

<p>Neither Father nor Mother appeared to want this
candid opinion particularly, and yet they didn’t appear
very sorry to have it. And they went home feeling
a little brighter for this interview; and, perhaps
shaken a little in the Victorian Attitude. It was inconceivable
that <i>She</i> would ever be able to do them credit;
but might it not be that they had alarmed themselves a
little unduly?</p>

<p>Still, it is easier, as a rule, to support the ills of
others than to bear one’s own. It was very well for
Warlock to take this optimistic view; but Philip was
not his son, and She was not his daughter-in-law.
Nevertheless, they were glad, on the whole, that the
wind had been tempered for them in this quarter. They
didn’t feel very forgiving just at present, though.</p>

<p>A little light was thrown upon the unlooked-for magnanimity
of the Friend of the Family about a week
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>later. For this the <i>Morning Post</i> was responsible, and
the illumination was the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A marriage has been arranged and will shortly take
place between the Marquis of Craigenputtock, eldest
son of the Duke and Duchess of Dumbarton, and the
Lady Adela Rocklaw, youngest daughter of the Earl of
Warlock, K. C. M. G.”</p>

<p>Everything for the best in the best of all possible
worlds, you see. Father and Mother rejoiced, of
course, at this cheering announcement; yet they did
not seem exactly to overflow with joy when they called
to convey their felicitations to dear Adela and her
papa. But more than ever now were they inclined to
doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of the latter in respect of the brave
face he had put on their common misfortune.</p>

<p>Still, most warmly and affectionately did they congratulate
Dumbarton’s future duchess, whom they had
the signal good fortune to find in black velvet with the
Himalayan Dust Spaniel reclining at her feet.</p>

<p>The Happy Young Man, twenty-two years of age
and rather fine drawn, was handing tea-cake. Pa had
rather a twinkle in his eye&mdash;Pa had no right to
let it be seen, though&mdash;when he presented the young
fellow to Mother and Father; and Mother and Father
congratulated him with the greatest warmth and spontaneity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>
<p>The felicitations were accepted of course in the spirit
in which they were offered; and for our part we are very
glad that dear Adela was able to let bygones be bygones,
for, as all the world knew, Father and Mother
had not been in the least to blame. Besides, it shows
there was a core of magnanimity in the girl, and for
this even we were hardly prepared, if we must confess
the truth.</p>

<p>Pray do not think that Adela’s good fortune was a
mere figure of speech, since there was every reason to
believe that the latest Scalp depending from the girdle
of the Huntress was in all respects a very choice specimen.
He looked one, certainly; and Mother, who was
quite competent to form an opinion on such an abstruse
subject, could tell by the way in which he handed hot
buttered tea-cake that he had a beautiful nature.</p>

<p>Then Father had been at Eton with his father, and
that, of course, was another point in the young man’s
favor.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the Ex-Ambassador, “I see in
<i>The Thunderer</i> this morning that Philip is going into
politics.”</p>

<p>This was news for Father. Mother was incredulous.</p>

<p>“And as a Tag, Rag and Bobtail, if you please,”
said Pa quietly.</p>

<p>Father it was who was now smitten with incredulity.</p>

<p>“Impossible,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Pa sent for <i>The Thunderer</i>, and there it was, as plain
as your hand, that Mr. Philip Shelmerdine, the son of
Lord Shelmerdine of Potterhanworth, had been adopted
by the party of progress to fight their cause at Blackhampton.</p>

<p>“Boy must be insane,” said Father. “He won’t get
in, at any rate&mdash;there’s that consolation. I don’t
know any man more unfitted for public life.”</p>

<p>“He may learn a wrinkle or two, though, Shelmerdine.
A deuced clever wife he’s married, you know.”</p>

<p>“He’ll need a clever wife if he is going to get in
as a Rag at Blackhampton. It’s&mdash;it’s an act of insanity.”</p>

<p>Then it was that Adela’s young man made his <i>faux
pas</i>.</p>

<p>“Married the celebrated actress, didn’t he?” said
Adela’s young man.</p>

<p>The only thing to be said for him is that he was not
at all well up in recent history.</p>

<p>Silence&mdash;complete and rather profound.</p>

<p>“I remember seeing her in a pantomime at Christmas,
and I thought she was the jolliest girl I had ever
seen&mdash;on the stage, I mean.”</p>

<p>The afterthought sounded sincere; and the whole
speech was animated by the best of intentions. But
it really was not very clever of the young fellow. Yes,
young fellow, this was a passage in which you did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>not shine particularly. Dumbarton’s future duchess
scowled at you&mdash;it would be idle to pretend that she
didn’t&mdash;Mother looked daggers; the great Proconsul’s
eyebrows said, “Shut up, you young fool,” as
audibly as eyebrows could indulge in that expression;
and your future father-in-law had that satyr-like air
which most people thought so damned unpleasant; but
to you, young man, in your heedlessness, these signs and
portents were without significance.</p>

<p>Your tenantry will doubtless keep always a warm
corner for you in their hearts; and when you lead your
charming bride to the altar you will be the recipient
of a massive silver tea-service, no doubt; but if you
continue in this way it is unlikely that posterity will
be able to point out your effigy in marble, and in knee-breeches,
too, to its great grandchildren as it walks
along Whitehall. Yes, really a very tactless young
fellow.</p>

<p>“Warlock,” said Father bitterly, “I think that boy
of mine must be mad. I wouldn’t have had this happen
for a very great deal. I don’t know what Vandeleur
will think, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you, Shelmerdine,” said the possessor of
the satyr-like air, smiling grimly at the empty fireplace.
“Vandeleur will think there is no tooth so keen
as man’s ingratitude.”</p>

<p>“Warlock,” said Father, with clenched hands, “it’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>damnable. And Vandeleur morbidly sensitive, too, on
the question of personal loyalty. Can’t we stop the
young scoundrel?”</p>

<p>Warlock, speaking in mournful accents proper to a
Constitutional crisis, failed to see how the young scoundrel
could be stopped without invoking the aid of a
commission in lunacy.</p>

<p>“Fellow’s mad enough, Warlock, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Shelmerdine, his latest action has all the
appearance of insanity.”</p>

<p>“This must go no farther, Warlock,” said the imperious
Ex-Resident of Barataria, North-West.</p>

<p>“I really hope it may not,” said the Ex-Ambassador;
“for the sake of you, for the sake of us, for the sake
of Vandeleur, for the sake of the Empire.”</p>

<p>A skeptical judgment might have doubted the sincerity
of such a speech proceeding from such a quarter,
but Father and Mother accepted it in simple good
faith.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="smaller">A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> people should be so vexed by things that other
people, equally serious of mind, don’t care twopence
about is one of the enigmas that is best left to the
philosophers.</p>

<p>Father and Mother were much upset by Mr. Philip’s
act of treachery. Yet there was really no need for
them to take it so tragically. The heir to the barony
had attained the age when a man is allowed to do a
little private thinking. But neither Father nor Mother
was in sympathy with that point of view.</p>

<p>Something must be done in this national crisis. Energetic
action must be taken. Mr. Vandeleur would
never forgive it; the Party would never forgive it; the
Country would never forgive it; the Empire would
never forgive it.</p>

<p>If you make a practice of thinking imperially, you
must view things on a comprehensive basis.</p>

<p>By the irony of circumstance, Mother and Father
were dining out that evening in the Inner Circles of the
Party. It was a small and quite unofficial occasion;
but several of the Heads would be there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>
<p>“Agatha, it is the deuce,” said the Proconsul, wrestling
with his white tie.</p>

<p>“It is that Woman, I am convinced. Phil-ipp has
been led on to this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what Vandeleur will say, I’m sure.
And such a supercilious fellow when he gets really <i>cross</i>.
Of course, I dissociate myself entirely from a step so
subversive.”</p>

<p>The Heads certainly received Father somewhat
askance that evening. In parenthesis, it may be remarked
that the world at large considered S. of P. as being
by way of a Head himself. But things are not always
what they seem, as Monsieur Bergson said of the
Nebular Hypothesis. A Head he was, of course, in ordinary
assembly; but this assembly, small though it was,
was by no means ordinary.</p>

<p>It was the Hostess, a massive daughter of Caledonia,
who first referred to the Vexed Subject, just as Father,
with a rather poor appetite, had begun upon his bird.</p>

<p>“Lord Shelmerdine, what is this one hears about your
son standing as a Rag?”</p>

<p>No; it was not exactly kind of Caledonia’s daughter.
The pause was awkward, particularly as Mr. Everard
Vandeleur was seated on the right of his hostess.</p>

<p>“I have no need to say that I dissociate myself entirely
from this ill-considered action,” said S. of P. at
length. “Beyond that I say nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“But you must say something, Shelmerdine,”
thought the Front Bench, of which Two were present
in addition to Mr. Everard Vandeleur. “It will create
a most unhappy impression in the country.”</p>

<p>“I can only attribute it to a mental aberration,” said
S. of P.</p>

<p>Mr. Everard Vandeleur shook his Jesuitical gray
curls.</p>

<p>“Shelmerdine, my dear fellow,” he said in tones vibrant
with emotion, “I would rather have lost five seats
in the country than this should have occurred.”</p>

<p>“I had rather you had done so, Vandeleur, than that
this should have taken place.”</p>

<p>“Can you impose no check?” said Mr. Vandeleur.
“Can you not refuse supply?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, no. The young scoundrel has a
private income. But I hold his wife responsible for
this.”</p>

<p>“His wife?” said Mr. Vandeleur.</p>

<p>“The root of an evil,” said the Husband of the Hostess,
who, to be sure, was right at the other end of the
mahogany.</p>

<p>“Your boy has married a wife, has he?” said Mr.
Vandeleur, with the air of one who asks politely for
information.</p>

<p>And who do you think, my lords and gentlemen, was
seated opposite the Great Man? No less an individual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>than his Britannic Majesty’s former Ambassador to
Persia.</p>

<p>Not a living soul saw the glance that may or may not
have passed between them.</p>

<p>“A great deal of marrying and giving in marriage
these days, apparently,” mused Mr. Everard Vandeleur.</p>

<p>“Your turn next, Van,” said a Privileged Individual,
whose brilliant sally, of course, set the table in a roar.</p>

<p>“Married a wife, has he?” mused Mr. Everard Vandeleur.
“Good for the state, although not always
good for the state of Denmark. And she has brought
him to this. Well, well.”</p>

<p>“It is revenge, of course,” said S. of P.</p>

<p>A word so sinister caused the whole table to cock its
ears.</p>

<p>“Revenge, Lord Shelmerdine!” said Caledonia’s
daughter.</p>

<p>“She is not received in the Family at present, and
we get this stab in the back in consequence.”</p>

<p>Two persons round the opposition mahogany were as
grim as griffins. One was Father and the other was
Mother. For the rest of the company it would be unsafe
to answer.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t she received in the Family?” said Caledonia’s
daughter, as blunt a woman as you would find
in a long day’s journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“He married contrary to the wishes of his parents,”
said Mother, preening her plumage at the hostess in a
way which said quite clearly that she would thank her to
be careful, as the ground was rather delicate. “Old-fashioned
ideas, perhaps, but such marriages can only
end in a general weakening of responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I am out of my depth,” said the plaintive Mr. Vandeleur.
“But the position as I envisage it, is this:
Your son’s wife, out of favor at Court, plots against
the dynasty. The dynasty trembles&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Vandeleur, it does nothing
of the kind,” said a very significant factor in the dynasty.</p>

<p>“Metaphorically, of course, Lady Shelmerdine. I
speak in metaphor. The dynasty trembles because a
bombshell has been thrown in the country&mdash;nothing
less than a bombshell, as I unhesitatingly affirm&mdash;and
to avert ruin one course only appears to be open to
it.”</p>

<p>“What is that course, Mr. Vandeleur?” said Lady
Shelmerdine.</p>

<p>“To compose this internecine quarrel, and avert a
further sanguinary conflict,” said Mr. Vandeleur.</p>

<p>A great man had spoken. Consols fell habitually at
his <i>Obiter Dicta</i>. French Rentes and Russia Fours
lost a whole point when he tore up his card in a medal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>round. No wonder that his outline of Imperial policy
received the most respectful attention.</p>

<p>“Let the Family receive her, and pray let us have
no more of it,” said Caledonia’s blunt daughter.</p>

<p>A suggestion of a great man in the interests of international
comity is one thing; but untimely interference
from one who has no <i>locus standi</i> beyond the fact
that she has three addresses and more diamonds than
are good for her, is quite another. Mother’s eyes
sparkled with the light of battle.</p>

<p>“Will it <i>really</i> make any difference to the Party, Mr.
Vandeleur, his standing for Blackhampton?”</p>

<p>“Bound to convey an unfortunate impression, Lady
Shelmerdine.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t possibly get in.”</p>

<p>“One is glad to know that. But, being the son of
his father, think of the weight he will carry with the
Rags!”</p>

<p>The compliment was a little double-edged, perhaps,
to some minds, but happily only one aspect of it was
visible except to the Cynical, with whom, of course, this
narrative has nothing to do.</p>

<p>“Why can’t he possibly get in?” inquired the Hostess.</p>

<p>“No brains,” said Father.</p>

<p>“At least, not many,” corrected Mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“All the more likely to be returned as a Rag by
Blackhampton,” said Caledonia’s daughter. “Don’t
you think so, Mr. Vandeleur?”</p>

<p>Mr. Vandeleur being a wise statesman, and the question
being rather technical, he ignored it blandly.</p>

<p>“Shelmerdine, I think you ought to realize that we
can’t have him standing for Blackhampton as a Rag in
any case, when we have barely enough candidates of our
own to go round.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do realize that, my dear Vandeleur. I realize
it most fully. Steps shall be taken. Steps shall be
taken at once.”</p>

<p>“Receive the girl in the Family&mdash;a nice girl, too,
I’m told&mdash;and let us hear no more of it,” said the
Hostess to Mother, who would not have been averse
from striking her for her effrontery.</p>

<p>What a pity it is that diamonds in excess are so demoralizing.</p>

<p>Full and ample forgiveness on the part of Grosvenor
Square seemed to be indicated, provided that a proper
humility and a reversion to the <i>status quo ante</i> was
forthcoming on the part of the erring. Let the young
woman be received in the Family, provided that the
heir to the barony withdrew his odious candidature for
Blackhampton, had said in effect the Leader of the
Opposition; and a tolerably easy constituency should
be provided for the young man. He might then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>emerge as a full-blown Wagger after a period of grace
in which to atone for his naughtiness.</p>

<p>Father and Mother drove home in the electric
brougham pondering deeply the wisdom of the sage.
It would mean a considerable sacrifice of personal dignity
thus to bargain with Her. They were a little surprised
and even a little grieved, perhaps, that the Great
Man had shown so scant a consideration for their
domestic feelings; but then it was a familiar trait of his
that he was ever ready to sacrifice the individual upon
the altar of Party.</p>

<p>It looked like Humble Pie, and patrician stomachs
are not very fond of that dish. But there did not
seem to be any way out of it. The ukase had gone
forth from the Chief that this wicked and immoral candidature
must not proceed. It was bound to create a
most unfortunate impression in the country. It only
remained for them, in the opinion of that wise and far-seeing
statesman, to swallow the bitter portion and
make peace on honorable terms.</p>

<p>“One thing, Agatha, we may congratulate ourselves
upon, at any rate,” said the Proconsul. “Vandeleur
took it much better than we had reason to expect.”</p>

<p>“That is very well, Wally. But don’t let us congratulate
ourselves too soon. It may not be so easy to
get him to withdraw as Mr. Vandeleur supposes.”</p>

<p>“But if we offer a clean slate?” said the Proconsul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>
<p>“When a man is clearly infatuated,” said Mother,
who was often inclined to sententiousness about this
hour of the evening, “you can count on nothing beyond
the fact that She will make herself as disagreeable as
possible.”</p>

<p>In what manner should the olive-branch be conveyed
by the dove of peace? Delicacy was called for.
Was Mother or was Father the better qualified to exercise
it? Mother had not been altogether a success in
the rôle of the diplomatist at large. It was idle to
shut one’s eyes to that fact, wasn’t it? But then, had
Father? Really, if it came to that, neither had much
margin for self-congratulation. And when all is said,
Humble Pie is not a very eupeptic form of diet.</p>

<p>“Wally,” said the Colthurst of Suffolk at the breakfast
table on the following morning, “I have given the
matter most anxious consideration, and I think, having
regard to everything, it is, perhaps, best left in my
hands.”</p>

<p>The Proconsul looked just a little dubious as he
removed the top of a hard-boiled egg.</p>

<p>“You are quite sure, Agatha, that you feel competent?”</p>

<p>“<i>Quite</i>, Wally.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you are right. I hope so, at all
events.”</p>

<p>It was decided that Mother should call in Knightsbridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
that afternoon upon Daughter-in-law, in spite of
the Danger.</p>

<p>“That I will risk,” said Mother, who at heart was an
Amazon. “Only once have I seen her, and that was
in Bedford Gardens, and she opened the door to me
holding a potato in one hand and a knife in the other.”</p>

<p>As the case had been represented to Father, he was
quite prepared to believe even that.</p>

<p>“If you would like me to accompany you, Agatha,”
said the Proconsul gallantly, “I will cut the Select
Committee this afternoon.”</p>

<p>But Mother seemed to feel quite competent to take
care of herself; and, after all, Father saw no real reason
to doubt her ability.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the punctual hour of half-past four
that afternoon, Mother entered the lift at Park Mansions,
and was hoisted in a patent elevator to the threshold
of the Guilty Pair.</p>

<p>Happily, on this occasion her ring was answered not
by a damsel, a knife and a potato, but by an undeniably
smart young parlor-maid, who was quite trim enough to
please the most severely critical.</p>

<p>Was Mrs. Shelmerdine at home?</p>

<p>The S. Y. P., who had charming natural manners,
smiled a really very nice affirmative.</p>

<p>As Mother entered the domain of the Guilty Pair,
it seemed to her that everything in the little vestibule,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>and there was hardly anything in it to speak of, was,
considering all things, in surprisingly good taste.</p>

<p>“Why, Mater, this is awfully sweet of you,” said
the manly voice of Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>Salutations of a filial and unaffected character. The
young man was really not deep enough to be wary.
All was about to be forgiven, evidently, else the good
old mater would not be calling upon ’em. Nevertheless,
a little surprise was in store for this optimist. Mary,
whose amiable custom it was to meet the whole world a
little more than half way, did not exactly throw herself
into the arms of Mother.</p>

<p>Mother, moreover, did not exactly cast herself upon
the neck of Mary.</p>

<p>They chose to shake hands rather than have recourse
to any less formal style of reception.</p>

<p>“So nice of you, Lady Shelmerdine, to find your way
up to our little foot in the air.”</p>

<p>It was said very cool and smiling, but if the young
minx had left it unsaid it would have been just as well,
perhaps, since somehow it didn’t seem to help things
particularly.</p>

<p>“The art furniture is more comfortable than it looks,
Lady Shelmerdine,” said the young Madam archly. “Try
this one. Don’t you like our yellow wall-paper? Phil-ipp’s
taste is so wonderful. Will you have some tea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Mother would be pleased to have some tea, but it was
by no means clear, for all that, that Mrs. Philip was yet
in the Family.</p>

<p>The young Madam poured out tea as though she
didn’t mind very much whether she was in the Family
or whether she wasn’t. Young ladies of Newnham and
Girton, we can’t help thinking, although it grieves us
terribly to criticize the Heroine, that this was very
wrong of her. Mother was eating Humble Pie, and she
ought to have been trying a little as well.</p>

<p>The Twin Brethren handed the tea to Mother in quite
their ablest manner.</p>

<p>“Have some muffin while it’s warm, Mater.”</p>

<p>Mother preferred bread and butter, thank you.</p>

<p>Conversation seemed to languish rather, until Mother
made the important discovery that you got quite a nice
view of the park.</p>

<p>“Toppin’!” said Mr. Philip.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid these flats must be dreadfully expensive,”
said the Maternal One.</p>

<p>“Not for the position, Mater.”</p>

<p>Mother hoped not, at any rate.</p>

<p>“I hope you have noticed our Whistler, Lady Shelmerdine?”
said Mary the demure.</p>

<p>Oh, <i>where</i> was the Whistler? Mother was <i>so</i> fond
of canaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>Calamity nearly overtook the muffin of Daughter-in-law.
Happily it stopped at very nearly.</p>

<p>“The little picture opposite, Lady Shelmerdine.
But you can’t really see it now the sun has got round
to the west.”</p>

<p>Mother had to examine the gem, of course, like any
other art critic. Glasses did great execution. Which
was the Whistler? Ah, yes, to be sure, the name of
the artist. An artist with a name so original was
bound to be rated highly. A present from Sir
Herbert Forrest, the famous actor-manager. Yes,
Mother had seen him as the Woodman in <i>Twelfth
Night</i>. How interesting to have such a memento from
such a famous man. And how <i>well</i> you could see the
park. And she did <i>hope</i> it was not too expensive.
And everything in such <i>good</i> taste, although yellow
for a wall-paper was a rather <i>modern</i> color. And such
<i>delicious</i> tea. And what <i>charming</i> cups. A present
from Mr. Vandeleur. How kind&mdash;a memento, of
course, of his respect and admiration for dear Phil-ipp’s
father.</p>

<p>“It didn’t say so on the card, though, Mater,” said
dear Phil-ipp with a clumsiness for which, perhaps, he
is to be forgiven. “It said on the card, ‘To Cinderella,
from a Humble Admirer who wishes her every happiness.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>So nice of Mr. Vandeleur to be so tactful. Could
there be a clearer indication of Mr. Vandeleur’s esteem
for a friend and colleague?</p>

<p>It hadn’t occurred to Hubby, though, that this really
charming china tea-set was in any way connected with
the great Proconsul.</p>

<p>Mother was a little hurt by this unfilial obtuseness.
As though there could be any other reason. Mr. Vandeleur
was so able, so responsible. However, the tea-service
was charming&mdash;and blue china, too.</p>

<p>These were elegant preliminaries, but Mother’s mission
was both high and delicate. <i>Enormous</i> tact was
needed, you know. <i>Suaviter in Modo</i> this time at least.</p>

<p>Was it correct that Philip was standing for Parliament?&mdash;Oh,
yes.</p>

<p>But as a Rag, Tag, and Bobtail, according to <i>The
Thunderer</i>?&mdash;Yes, the Leading Morning Journal was
correctly informed.</p>

<p>Somehow that seemed merely to leave matters in a
state of suspended animation. Philip was pleasantly
frank, yet without being particularly communicative.
Mrs. Philip seemed wholly absorbed in the vernal prospect.</p>

<p>“I am sure, dear Phil-ipp, you will be sorry to know
that your father is upset.”</p>

<p>Like a dutiful son, Phil-ipp was <i>awfully</i> sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>“And Mr. Vandeleur, of course. Your father was
the last peer made by his Gover’ment. So wounding to
a man as sensitive as Mr. Vandeleur!”</p>

<p>Mr. Philip was awfully sorry that his little adventure
was being taken so seriously by people whom he would
not have supposed would have paid it any attention.</p>

<p>“But, dear Phil-ipp,” said Mother, “your father
holds such a <i>special</i> position in public life. He is <i>so</i>
upset. A real grief to him, with the affairs of the
country in their present deplorable state. The Constitution,
you know&mdash;! <i>Dear</i> Phil-ipp, have you fully
considered the question?”</p>

<p>Oh, yes, dear Phil-ipp had considered the question&mdash;that
is, as well as he was able to. He didn’t pretend
that he knew very much about it; but Polly rather
thought&mdash;the prophetic soul of Mother!&mdash;but Polly
rather thought that a man of means and leisure ought
to go into Parliament, and try and make himself useful
to the world. Not that personally he felt he would be
of any use at all.</p>

<p>“I can only say, dear Phil-ipp,” said Mother, “that
your father is much upset; Mr. Vandeleur is much upset;
the Party is much upset; and we have all talked
about you quite anxiously. Don’t you realize what an
amount of political capital will be made of your standing
as a Rag by the enemies of the Empire?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have thought anybody would have cared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>twopence about it, Mater. It isn’t as though I had any
ability.”</p>

<p>“It is not <i>you</i>, of course, who matters so much. It
is your dear father who carries so much weight in the
country.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Philip supposed, though not at all disrespectfully,
that a chap of twenty-eight was entitled
to have views of his own.</p>

<p>Mother didn’t quite agree with that general proposition.
There were some things, for instance, Religion
and Politics to name only two, although there were
others she could have mentioned, in which it was only
right for a well-born and expensively nurtured Englishman
to defer to the more matured wisdom of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip was awfully sorry, but he rather believed
in Progress.</p>

<p>Mother was a little inclined to snort at Progress.
What, pray, did one who had got as far as he had
want with Progress! As far as Mother could see, the
current idea of Progress was to take money out of the
pockets of those who were better off than yourself, and
put it into your own.</p>

<p>“And there is no reason for <i>you</i> to resort to that,
Phil-ipp,” said Mother, with a sudden effusion of Inspired
Commonsense; “because you have more than the
majority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Daughter-in-law, still looking through the window,
and wholly absorbed in contemplation of the vernal
prospect, was suddenly overwhelmed by a dreadful fear
lest the histrionic temperament, which was her own private
and particular cross, should make an exhibition of
itself.</p>

<p>Mother was fearfully good at argument, and always
had been. Phil-ipp, of course, was the merest child at
it, even though he had been selected by the Party of
Progress to fight their great cause. Mother in her inmost
heart thought it was the clearest proof of the contemptible
level of Rag intellect, that any body of registered
voters should have brought themselves to confide
in any such candidate. And Mother nearly boiled over
when Mr. Philip made an even more abject confession
of his impotence.</p>

<p>“Come and argue with the Mater a bit,” said he to
fair Nature’s admirer, still at gaze upon the vernal
prospect. “She’s much too clever for me.”</p>

<p>Should Mother take off the gloves? No, decidedly
more Politic not to remove them. Mother’s third chin
advanced a little, though, in spite of herself. This
daughter of the people was likely to know more about
the peeling of potatoes than of the conduct of high
politics.</p>

<p>At the summons of her lord, however, the young
minx controlled her mobile features as well as in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>lay; and in that designing mind was the question,
Should she toy a little with this Victorian Mamma? Or
should she exercise her arts and blandishments?</p>

<p>“It is so wrong of Phil-ipp,” said Mother, “and I
think <i>you</i> ought to exercise the influence that every
wife&mdash;that is, if she is good and worthy&mdash;has with
her husband, and dissuade him from this course. You
do see, do you not, that it is most injudicious for a man
in his position?”</p>

<p>“Well, Lady Shelmerdine,” said Mischief, having
decided in favor of the broader way, “Phil-ipp looks
at it like this&mdash;don’t you, Phil-ipp? The Rags do
get on a bit, but the Waggers are generally going
backwards.”</p>

<p>Followed an academic discussion of the Situation.
A most immoral proceeding, Mother was bound to believe.
Ingratitude could not further go than for the
eldest son of the very last peer created by Mr. Vandeleur’s
Gover’ment to go over horse, foot and artillery,
to the foe.</p>

<p>“To what extent ought a son to suffer for the indiscretion
of his father?” inquired Mischief solemnly.</p>

<p>Mother begged pardon; she didn’t understand.
Daughter-in-law seemed unable to render the question
any clearer.</p>

<p>At this point the Conference seemed to take a turn
for the worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>Did Mrs. Shelmerdine really suppose, said Mother in
crystal tones, that young men in the position of her husband
had no responsibilities to society?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Mrs. Shelmerdine was quite sure they had,
and that was why personally she was so glad he had
decided to throw in his lot with the party of Progress.</p>

<p>Progress, said Mother&mdash;What, pray, is Progress?</p>

<p>The question was rather difficult for a young married
woman to answer. But fortunately it appeared that
Phil-ipp was not depending wholly upon dialectics in
the coming battle.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Yes, that was rather subtle for Mother.</p>

<p>“I suppose you feel, Lady Shelmerdine,” said the
young wife, “that if he depended entirely on his mental
powers he would have no chance of getting in.”</p>

<p>Mother ignored the question, perhaps a little pointedly.</p>

<p>Well, it seemed that Phil-ipp had several other strings
to his bow.</p>

<p>Mother had implicit faith, however, in the essential
good sense of her countrymen in the Midlands. They
were such shrewd people in the Midlands; and Mother
hoped and believed they would demand qualities more
positive than those guaranteed by the fact that the Rag
candidate was the eldest son of a distinguished father.</p>

<p>Mischief agreed; but if the Candidate was able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>kick three goals against Aston Villa, which he was quite
capable of doing if he went into special training for
the purpose, in the opinion of the local experts, there
was no power on earth that could keep him from the
head of the poll.</p>

<p>This, of course, took Mother out of her depth completely.
She herself was something of an old parliamentary
hand; and she had gained first-hand experience
in the days when the Proconsul was merely Sir Walter
and a light of the House of Commons. But this was
beyond her.</p>

<p>Mother had never heard of Aston Villa; and when
Daughter-in-law took pains to explain who Aston
Villa was, somehow Mother didn’t seem much enlightened.
But of one thing she was sure. To fight a parliamentary
election upon any such basis was subversive
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>No, somehow the Conference didn’t seem to prosper.
Nevertheless, Mother was there with the olive-branch;
but really, in the circumstances, she didn’t quite see
what use could be made of the floral emblem. Still, an
effort would have to be made.</p>

<p>To do justice to Mother, she was quite prepared to eat
Humble Pie. It was most unlikely that any good would
come of the act of deglutition; still, desperate remedies
were called for.</p>

<p>“To be perfectly candid, Phil-ipp,” said Mother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>really getting to business at last, “your father has taken
counsel of Mr. Vandeleur&mdash;most anxious counsel;
and, acting upon his suggestion, he is fully prepared
to offer a warm welcome to you both in Grosvenor
Square; and he very much hopes you will allow your
name to be withdrawn, and sometime, quite soon, Mr.
Vandeleur himself will find you a constituency, because
he is really concerned that a young man of such promise
should be lost to the party.”</p>

<p>Thus did Mother grapple right nobly with the unsavory
cates. Perhaps her table manners were not quite
so delicate as some people’s might have been; but let
none be so heartless as to criticize her when she is wrestling
so nobly with her Cross.</p>

<p>Phil-ipp and Mary were touched, of course, by the
liberal offer; touched very deeply, although they didn’t
quite see how it would be possible for the former to go
back on his principles, even allowing for the fact that
the fatted calf is such delectable fare. They were awfully
nice about it, though, which is, of course, what
you would expect them to be; very gentle and polite
and even affectionate with Mother, who was doing her
best in circumstances quite foreign to her nature.</p>

<p>All the same, the conclusion of the Conference was
by no means all that could have been desired. The
guilty pair had involved themselves so deeply with Blackhampton
that they couldn’t very well draw back. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
it was not wholly clear that they wanted to.
After all, a man who had attained the ripe age of
twenty-eight might aspire to a few convictions. Phil-ipp
felt so strongly that the future lay with the party
of Progress.</p>

<p>Mother failed undoubtedly in her diplomatic errand.
And no doubt the measure of her failure was in her
parting words that dear Phil-ipp would never be forgiven
by his father if he persisted in going to the poll.</p>

<p>Mother took an affectionate leave of her peccant son,
but her leave of Daughter-in-law was very guarded.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR FREE TRADE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Things</span> had to go forward at Blackhampton in
spite of the Ukase, and forward they went right merrily.
The adoption of Philip was a fine stroke on the
part of the Rags, because the Blackhampton Rovers
had a following of about thirty thousand persons
weekly, and one and all of these acclaimed it as quite
the right policy. The famous inside right had had
in his day&mdash;which was not so very far off either&mdash;only
one superior in that responsible position, and he
was Steve Bloomer. If the Rag candidate could only
reproduce his form on a great occasion, he was bound
to go straight to the top of the poll.</p>

<p>A general election was expected in the autumn.
Philip and Mary spent August at Trouville in order to
prepare for the fray. Philip trained on the sands, and
Mary composed speeches while she listened to the seductive
strains of Monsieur Marly’s Marine Orchestra.
And then, when this delightful month was over, they
went to Blackhampton in fighting trim; hired a house for
three months on its outskirts, and set to work in grim
earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>In a very short time they were the two most popular
people in this rather unalluring city. It was democratic
to the core; and the fact that the Rag candidate
was the son of Mr. Vandeleur’s very last creation was
made a cardinal point by his opponents. But, as the
candidate said with simple pathos at every meeting&mdash;Gentlemen,
it is not fair to hold me responsible for
my father. No man ought to be held responsible for
his father. I am doing my level best to live down my
father, gentlemen, and in so doing I look confidently for
the support of every follower of the Rovers in this
room, for they, I know, are good sportsmen.</p>

<p>Whereupon the good sportsmen in question invariably
roared themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>And then the Candidate would proceed: Gentlemen,
I am not much use at a speech. But I’ll just say this.
I hope we shall beat the Villa on Saturday. (Uproar.)
It won’t be for want of trying, anyhow. (Uproar.)
And if we do manage to beat ’em, and I think we
shall&mdash;(cries of “Good lad!”)&mdash;I hope you will be
kind enough to forgive my oratory (cries of “Rather!”
and loud cheering).</p>

<p>And now, gentlemen, I am going to ask my wife,
who is a far better speaker than I am, to say a few
words. There is no need for me to make you known
to one another, because she tells me you are all old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>friends of hers. (Loud cheers, and cries of “Sing us a
song, Mary!”)</p>

<p>Mary, looking like a picture-postcard, would then
sit down to the piano, which with great foresight had
been provided by the Executive Committee, and proceed
to sing that famous ballad from <i>Iolanthe</i> about
good Queen Bess’s glorious days when the House of
Lords did nothing in particular, and did it very well.
That was pretty well for a beginning; and the audience
would be so delighted with this effort that she was not
allowed to get to her speech until she had sung all
the old favorites that had made her so famous. And
then, when she had sung all her songs, the Chairman,
Mr. Alderman Slocock, would interpose and say that
it was really not fair to insist on her making a speech,
because if they did she might have no voice left the
following evening for the great meeting at the Corn
Exchange. And this course having been commended
by the meeting as a rare example of political foresight,
the proceedings terminated with the usual vote of confidence,
in which there was not a single dissentient
voice.</p>

<p>Aston Villa were beaten handsomely on the following
Saturday; and, although the Candidate only managed
to kick one goal, he showed so much of his old form
that it was clear already that another striking blow had
been delivered against the House of Lords. In fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>that tottering institution had not a look in, really. Its
meetings were very tame affairs by comparison, even
if the standard of speech-making was thought by some
people to be higher. But little or no interest was taken
in them; while at those of the unfilial young man,
who was going to take away his father’s Veto, there
wasn’t even standing room an hour before the proceedings
began.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was going to be a signal triumph
for the People’s Cause. The Candidate combined so
well with the rest of the Rovers’ forwards that the
Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten on their own
ground, and Manchester City were simply annihilated.
“Deeds not Words” flamed forth in the Rag colors,
a vivid orange, from every hoarding. If the Candidate
only kept up his form, said those who knew (and there
was a surprising amount of omniscience in Blackhampton
just now), the Rovers were bound to win the Cup
and Mr. Balsquith would make him Home Secretary
immediately.</p>

<p>In spite of all the adulation he received, the Candidate
remained very simple and modest about it all.
Even after he had scored two goals against Sheffield
Wednesday, he never attempted any particular flight of
oratory. The Missus could do all that so much better.
No doubt she could have done, but South-West Blackhampton
was far too wise in its day and generation to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>give her the chance. Let her attend to the piano.
That, in the opinion of South-West Blackhampton, was
so much more important.</p>

<p>The dissolution of Parliament occurred in the middle
of November. A crowded and glorious fortnight followed.
Notts Forest were beaten; a draw was made
with Sunderland; and on the very eve of the poll Tottenham
Hotspur received a most crushing reverse.</p>

<p>For the second time in its ignoble history, Protection
was not only dead but damned.</p>

<p>It was all over bar the shouting, even before the fateful
day had dawned. The Flag-Waggers could hardly
raise a waggle; the sitting member realized already that
he had lost his seat. Blackhampton went solidly for the
Rags, and the best inside right in England&mdash;never mind
Steve Bloomer!&mdash;was hoisted with a noble majority to
the top of the poll.</p>

<p>Unparalleled scenes were enacted in Market Square.
The horses were taken out of the New Member’s carriage,
and he and his charming wife were drawn in
triumph through the principal streets.</p>

<p>A deputation with Alderman Slocock at its head
waited on the New Member at his committee room the
morning after the declaration of the poll. The Rovers
hoped in all humility that their famous inside right
would not desert them now.</p>

<p>Desert the Rovers! Nothing was further from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>New Member’s intention. Certainly he would play for
them for the rest of the season if only they were good
enough to choose him. And the deputation withdrew,
after further congratulations upon his deserved success,
and having further acclaimed him as a true sportsman.</p>

<p>Some members of Parliament might have been rather
bored by having to play every week for the Blackhampton
Rovers, but that was not the case with Philip.
He had renewed his youth; never in his life had he more
thoroughly enjoyed this manly game. Besides, he had
all Blackhampton for his friends. He was a really
great man in Blackhampton, and even self-effacing people
like to know that places exist where their merits are
appreciated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the news reached Grosvenor
Square that the Rags had gained a seat at Blackhampton,
and that the turnover of votes had been tremendous,
surprise was mingled with consternation.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t as if the fellow had any brains,” said
Father to everybody.</p>

<p>Mother, however, informed the world privately that
she always thought dear Phil-ipp had been underrated
by his father. It was very wrong, of course, to stand
as a Rag, but no young man wholly devoid of ability
could possibly have gained a seat like South-West
Blackhampton with such an enormous majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>Still, Grosvenor Square was quite at a loss to understand
it. But one thing was clear. The breach was
widened by this painful incident; at least, Father, in his
blindness, thought so. Had failure been the portion
of this wicked revolt, forgiveness would have been easier.
Its dazzling success seemed to put forgiveness out of the
question.</p>

<p>Mother, perhaps, was inclined to weaken a bit. After
all, did it really matter so much? And was it not better
than leading an idle and useless life? However misplaced
the ambition, surely it was an evidence of that
dormant ability, which in her heart she had always
known to be there, since her family was never without
it.</p>

<p>Father, however, was adamant. It was an open
flout. Moreover, it had rendered him ridiculous in the
Inner Circle, which, however, so far from viewing the
matter with exaggerated grief was rather inclined to
see in it a joke of a high order. Why this should have
been the case Father had no means of knowing. To
one of his own staunch principles it was certainly no
laughing matter.</p>

<p>As time passed, the maternal heart of Mother was
disposed to relent, but Father, alas! would not hear of
compromise. He felt too keenly this double act of
filial disloyalty. It was rather absurd to view things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>in this light, said the friends of both parties, but the
Proconsul was adamant.</p>

<p>He went his way, and Philip and Mary went theirs.
In spite of their wrong-doing the guilty pair contrived
to be extremely happy in the little nest at Knightsbridge.
But Father, alas! grew exceedingly miserable.</p>

<p>Even Mother had come to agree with the world, that
Father was not behaving with his usual wisdom. Mrs.
Philip was really less Bohemian than Mother had feared,
in spite of the incident of the potato. If she were
duly encouraged, she might have the makings of a good
wife.</p>

<p>Indeed, by the time the Guilty Pair had been married
a little more than a year, Mrs. Philip certainly fulfilled
one of the important duties incident to the degree in
life to which it had pleased Providence to call her. As
a matter of fact, she overdid it a little, in the opinion
of persons qualified to speak with authority. She presented
Philip with Twins.</p>

<p>Alas! even when the glad news was borne to Father,
he remained firm in his attitude. He still played the
part of Achilles sulking in his tent, although it was
openly said by all right-minded people that such conduct
was entirely unworthy of a great Proconsul.</p>

<p>One thing was clear, however, now that this joyful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>event had occurred. The little nest in Knightsbridge
was no longer adequate. A move was therefore made
to a more commodious abode in Pont Street.</p>

<p>Philip was almost ridiculously proud to be a father.
He went up and down the metropolis in a way that must
have been intolerable to those who do not love the human
race. He had “had his leg pulled” pretty severely
over his return for South-West Blackhampton,
but that was nothing in comparison with what he had
now to endure.</p>

<p>“What are you going to call ’em, Shel, old boy?”
was the greeting of all and sundry.</p>

<p>Two lusty men they were, whose lungs thus early in
life did infinite credit to both parents.</p>

<p>To the credit of Mother, be it said, the Twins proved
altogether too much for her. She hauled down her
flag completely, and even went to the length of consenting
to meet the goddaughter of Edward Bean in consultation.
There had been faults on both sides, perhaps.
Still, the goddaughter of Edward Bean, whose
eyesight, to be sure, was not what it used to be, was
only able to see faults on one side.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the lion lay down with the lamb; and
Mother herself took charge of the removal to Pont
Street. Moreover, she even went to the length of
choosing a desirable residence; and insisted on furnishing
it in part with a dole from the privy purse. Yet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>while Mother was behaving in this rational and sensible
manner and was thus laying up a store of happiness
for herself, Father declined to be comforted, and every
day made himself more unhappy.</p>

<p>Tragedy began to hover around the pillows of the
great Proconsul. His appetite declined; his clothes
no longer fitted him; no longer did he seem to care
about public business as of yore. Instead of the succession
being doubly secure, the Family might have been
threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE END OF THE TALE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Mary’s custom to give the Twins an airing
in the park every morning when the weather was fine.
Like a wise young mother, she personally undertook
this important duty; trundling the perambulator herself,
and gaining health and happiness thereby, in spite
of the emphatic protests of Philip, who seemed to think
that nursemaids had been invented for that purpose.</p>

<p>This was a subject, however, upon which Mary was
a little inclined to dogmatism. A mother who was
young and strong, and as absurdly proud as she was of
her progeny, should show herself to be worthy of the
good gifts of heaven by taking a thoroughly practical
interest in their welfare. This was pretty sound doctrine,
the Member for Blackhampton was obliged to
admit, although personally he rather thought that nursemaids&mdash;</p>

<p>Mary had no belief in nursemaids.</p>

<p>Thereupon the proud father, in spite of an involuntary
shudder of the Twin Brethren&mdash;within his own
breast, of course, not those within the vehicle&mdash;felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>that he himself should be allowed to undertake this
onerous duty.</p>

<p>Mary laughed at this. It was not the business of
Man to push perambulators, and no self-respecting
woman would ever endure the spectacle.</p>

<p>The pushing of the perambulator had all the elements
of a pretty little quarrel in it; but these young married
people were much too modern and sensible to conduct
themselves in that old and foolish fashion. <i>Amantium
iræ</i> amused them not. Real pals don’t snarl at one another,
whatever Q. Horatius may have to say upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Therefore the proud father had to capitulate. Besides,
said Mary, it would never do for white spats by
Grant and Cockburn to condescend to such a menial occupation.
The Button Club would certainly expel their
wearer if he was guilty of any such solecism. Even as
it was, rumor had it that he had been severely reprimanded
by the Committee for daring to stand as a Rag
for Blackhampton, and worse, of getting himself elected
by a considerable majority. If he were to be seen
pushing a “pram” in the park on a fine June morning,
he would be compelled to resign his membership
of the institution.</p>

<p>The member for Blackhampton had to yield; and
Mary was left in undisputed possession of her perambulator
and its lusty occupants. And certainly, as she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>trundled the vehicle along the railings of the Row, she
looked just about the nicest and proudest and happiest
young mother in the metropolis. It is true that on one
occasion when the proud father was accompanying the
procession <i>à cheval</i>, one of England’s future duchesses
gave the young mother and her perambulator a decidedly
disdainful look as she passed them; and also
that one of England’s future dukes looked very hard
at them, and, moreover, turned round to stare after
them, which was hardly what you would expect, and we
hope you will pardon his grossly unducal behavior.
Still, the provocation was great. Here was one of the
mothers of the nation to which we are all proud to
belong, whether we are Rags or whether we are
Waggers, a simple, sensible, square-browed young matron,
a picture of well-being, who, having given two
noble kids to the world, was determined to look after
’em.</p>

<p>The young woman with the perambulator made a
fascinating picture on these fine June mornings, along
by the railings of the Row; and had it been painted
by Rembrandt or Velasquez or some other old and respectable
painter, a good deal of money might have
been offered for it by cosmopolitan millionaires.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Young Woman with the Perambulator became
rather a source of remark for some of the <i>habitués</i>
of the thoroughfare. Elderly gentlemen with well-brushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
side-whiskers, grandfathers all, remarked upon
her to other elderly gentlemen. Sensible girl, they
said, doing good to herself and to the nation at large,
and setting an example to others. It was far better
than leaving ’em to nursemaids and suchlike careless
hussies. You <i>know</i> that they are all right when you
have charge of them yourself.</p>

<p>It chanced one morning as the procession followed
its accustomed course, with Philip near at hand, mounted
on a quadruped that had turned out better as a hack
than as a ’chaser, a distinguished personage came upon
the scene in faultless morning attire. He was none
other than Arminius Wingrove.</p>

<p>A man of such wisdom could not do less than stay
to admire the Twins. For the life of him, though, he
couldn’t say which side of the family they favored most.
Walter Augustus, named after the misguided Grandpapa
who had declined to attend the christening, had
certainly the eyes of his mother; Philip Archibald had
certainly the eyes of his mother also. The nose of
Philip Archibald was, undoubtedly, that of his father;
the nose of Walter Augustus was undoubtedly that of
his father also; while as for the mouth, the mouth of
both Walter Augustus and Philip Archibald was undoubtedly
that of both parents. Still, it must not be
thought that Walter Augustus and Philip Archibald
had always to endure those imposing names. One was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>called Bow and the other was called Wow in domestic
circles.</p>

<p>So unfeigned was the admiration of Arminius Wingrove
that nothing would content him but that he should
turn and accompany the procession as far as the
Achilles statue. But before they were able to gain that
desirable bourn, which itself commemorates a great moment
in the life of the nation, yet one more historic incident
was destined to occur. Alas, that its only commemoration
is like to be these unworthy pages!</p>

<p>However, if the Board of Supererogation, evidences
of whose romantic disposition are to be found all over
our fair metropolis, really feels disposed to mark the
precise spot where this historic episode came to pass, it
may be said that it was exactly opposite the little kiosk
for the sale of newspapers and other undesirable forms
of literature which has been permitted to invade the
chaste precincts of what was once considered the most
exclusive spot in all London.</p>

<p>An elderly gentleman in a glossy silk hat, with well-brushed
eyebrows and of a mien of generally composed
importance, was debouching slowly yet all unknown into
this historic episode. He was not looking very happy
for all that he wore his habitual air of distinction. He
was a Proconsul, and full many of the passers-by
saluted him respectfully. But he did not seem in anywise
the better for these manifestations of public regard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>
<p>If the truth must be told of this elderly gentleman,
sorrow and envy were the occupants of his heart this
lovely June morning, when even the metropolitan prospect
was all that was fair and gracious. He was the
most miserable grandfather in London, instead of being
the proudest and happiest, as he certainly ought to have
been.</p>

<p>In his stately progress he passed other grandfathers.
They were walking with their sons and daughters, and
with the sons and daughters of their sons and daughters,
and looking immeasurably the better for the privilege.
Surely, it was good to be a grandfather on this
fine June morning. It seemed a perfectly honorable
and rational and proper state of being.</p>

<p>Every yard he walked, the conviction grew firmer in
him that this was the case. It was surely the duty of
elderly gentlemen with well-brushed eyebrows to rejoice
in that degree. There was a man he knew well, a member
of Parliament, looking so pink and prosperous, with
a small girl holding one hand and a small boy holding
the other. Envy and sorrow were not in that heart, it
was certain.</p>

<p>Could it be that his recent policy had been vain and
weak and shortsighted? The great Proconsul had never
asked himself such questions before, but it was becoming
increasingly clear to him that he would have to
be asking them presently. A grandfather had surely no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>right to make himself as ridiculous as he had done.</p>

<p>Then it was that the great Proconsul came right opposite
the Achilles statue, and the episode to which we
have already referred got itself made into history. A
certain Mr. Wingrove, a famous dramatist who had
been elected recently under the rule <i>honoris causâ</i> to
Grandfather’s club, and with whom Grandfather was
upon pleasantly familiar terms, came into view. Walking
by the side of Mr. Wingrove was a charming-looking
girl. She had charge of a most commodious double
perambulator, and so proudly was she trundling it that
it was quite clear to the acute perception of the great
Proconsul that this was a case of Twins.</p>

<p>Grandfather, in his present somewhat emotional state,
must needs stop and shake Mr. Wingrove heartily by
the hand. And, further, he was constrained to offer
his sincere congratulations. He overflowed with admiration.</p>

<p>“And <i>what</i> are their names?” he asked.</p>

<p>“One is called Bow, and the other is called Wow,”
said the demure young mother.</p>

<p>It seemed passing strange to Mr. Wingrove that the
great Proconsul should not know the names of his own
grandchildren, and, moreover, that he should not recognize
them and their mother. Then a light dawned
suddenly upon him. Further, it seemed to this sagacious
mind that in the absence of the lawful father,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>who had turned his horse and who was going now
down the Row at a canter, that a legitimate opportunity
had presented itself for the exercise of the comic
spirit.</p>

<p>“I should really like my wife to see them,” said the
great Proconsul. “Such splendid fellows; the picture
of health.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, by all means,” said Mr. Wingrove, with a
rather sly smile at the proud young mother.</p>

<p>No time like the present. If Mrs. W. didn’t mind
bringing along these infant phenomena as far as Grosvenor
Square, which is hardly ten minutes’ walk from
the Achilles statue as the crow flies, he was sure that
Lady S. would be enchanted.</p>

<p>The gracious young matron would be delighted to
take them round to Grosvenor Square for the inspection
of the wife of this most agreeable elderly gentleman,
whose name, by the way, she had not the pleasure
of knowing. All the same, the mention of Grosvenor
Square and the demeanor of Mr. Wingrove combined
to give the young madam a pretty shrewd suspicion.</p>

<p>As for Arminius Wingrove, he was amazed at the
resource and the boldness of Providence, which, of
course, he was quite entitled to be. And in that, to
be sure, he was by no means singular. Many first-rate
minds have been similarly occupied for some little time
past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>
<p>Grandfather, all unconscious of the wicked trick that
Fate had put upon him, prattled along by the side of
the four-wheeled chariot; and he was presently moved
to indulge in the proud confidence that they had recently
had Twins in the Family.</p>

<p>“Oh, really,” said Mr. Wingrove.</p>

<p>“Oh, how interesting,” said the proud young mother,
not to be outdone in gravity.</p>

<p>“I must really go and see ’em,” said Grandfather.</p>

<p>“Oh, haven’t you seen them yet?” said the fair
charioteer.</p>

<p>Not yet. It seemed that a Proconsul had so many
calls upon his attention.</p>

<p>“Well, if I was their mother, I don’t think I should
be very pleased with <i>you</i>. Haven’t you been rather
remiss, Mr.&mdash;? I haven’t the pleasure of knowing your
name.”</p>

<p>“Lord Shelmerdine,” said Mr. Wingrove, hastening
to atone for his sin of omission.</p>

<p>By this, they were waiting to cross Park Lane.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell him yours?” whispered the famous playwright
to Mrs. Philip.</p>

<p>“No, of course you mustn’t,” said that designing
young Madam. “Unless you want to spoil everything.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
